  <synopsis>
    <p>Applies action expressions on selected elements.</p>
  </synopsis>

  <module-doc>
    <description>
      <p><this/> evaluates <param>commit</param> as a list of elements, then <param>target</param> as a list of elements on each commit element, then <param>action</param> on each target element.</p>
      <p><this/> is useful when <param>action</param> is a side-effect expression. The side-effect expressions allowed are controlled by: <param>createDocuments</param>, <param>createSections</param>, <param>createRelations</param>, <param>createTuples</param>, <param>createAnnotations</param>, <param>setArguments</param>, <param>setFeatures</param> and <param>deleteElements</param>. If these parameters are not set to true then <this/> will refuse to evaluate the corresponding side-effect expressions.</p>
      <p><this/> commits the changes on the data structure when each <param>commit</param> element is done. When processing very large corpora, set <param>commit</param> to reach documents or sections.</p>
    </description>
  
    <param-doc name="commit">
      <p>Elements after which to commit changes. The expression is evaluated as a list of elements with the corpus as the context element.</p>
    </param-doc>
  
    <param-doc name="target">
      <p>Elements on which to perform the action. The expression is evaluated as a list of elements with the commit element as the context element.</p>
    </param-doc>

    <param-doc name="action">
      <p>Action to perform on each result of <param>target</param>.</p>
