  <synopsis>
    <p>Disambiguate features that have multiple values.</p>
  </synopsis>

    <description>
      <p><this/> evaluates <param>target</param> as a list of elements with the current document as the context element. Then it tries to keep a single value for the feature <param>ambiguousFeature</param> in each item in the result. To achieve this, it keeps a set of unambiguous values found in the document. Unambiguous values are found in elements for which there is a single value for <param>ambiguousFeature</param>.
