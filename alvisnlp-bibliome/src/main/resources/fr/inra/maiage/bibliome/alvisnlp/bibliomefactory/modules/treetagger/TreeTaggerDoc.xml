    <p>Runs <em>tree-tagger</em>.</p>
  </synopsis>

  <module-doc>
    <description>
      <p><this/> applies <em>tree-tagger</em> on annotations in <param>wordLayer</param> by generating an appropriate input file. This file will contain one line for each annotation. The first column, the token surface form, is the value of the <param>formFeature</param> feature. The second column, the token predefined POS tag, is the value <param>posFeature</param> feature. The third column, the token predefined lemma, is the value of <param>lemmaFeature</param> feature. If <param>posFeature</param> or <param>lemmaFeature</param> are not defined, then the second and third column are left blank.</p>
      <p>The <em>tree-tagger</em> binary is specified by <param>treeTaggerExecutable</param> and the language model to use is specified by <param>parFile</param>. Additionally a lexicon file can be given through <param>lexiconFile</param>.</p>
      <p>If <param>sentenceLayer</param> is defined, then <this/> considers annotations in this layer as sentences. Sentence boundaries are reinforced by providing <em>tree-tagger</em> an additional end-of-sentence marker.</p>
      <p>Once <em>tree-tagger</em> has processed the corpus, <this/> adds the predicted POS tag and lemma to the respective <param>posFeature</param> and <param>lemmaFeature</param> features of the corresponding annotations.</p>
      <p>If <param>recordDir</param> and <param>recordFeatures</param> are both defined, then <em>tree-tagger</em> predictions are written into files in one file per section in the <param>recordDir</param> directory. <param>recordFeatures</param> is an array of feature names to record. An additional feature <em>n</em> is recognized as the annotation ordinal in the section.</p>
