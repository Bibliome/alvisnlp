  <synopsis>
    <p>Projects rows in XLS or XLSX files on sections.</p>
  </synopsis>

  <module-doc>
    <description>
      <p><this/> reads <param>xlsFile</param> in Microsoft Excel XLS or XLSX formats and searches for row entries in sections.</p>
      <p>The parameters <param>allowJoined</param>, <param>allUpperCaseInsensitive</param>, <param>caseInsensitive</param>, <param>ignoreDiacritics</param>, <param>joinDash</param>, <param>matchStartCaseInsensitive</param>, <param>skipConsecutiveWhitespaces</param>, <param>skipWhitespace</param> and <param>wordStartCaseInsensitive</param> control the matching between the section and the entry keys.</p>
      <p>The <param>subject</param> parameter specifies which text of the section should be matched. There are two options:
      <ul>
	<li>the entries are matched on the contents of the section, <param>subject</param> can also control if matches boundaries coincide with word delimiters;</li>
	<li>the entries are matched on the feature value of annotations of a given layer separated by a whitespace, in this way entries can be searched against word lemmas for instance.</li>
      </ul>
      </p>
      <p><this/> creates an annotation for each matched row and adds these annotations to the layer named <param>targetLayer</param>. The created annotations will have features whose keys correspond to <param>valueFeatures</param> and values to the data associated to the matched entry (columns in the XLS file). For instance if <param>valueFeatures</param> is <em>[a,b,c]</em>, then each annotation will have three features named <em>a</em>, <em>b</em> and <em>c</em> with the respective values of the entry's second, third and fourth columns. A feature name left blank in <param>valueFeatures</param> will not create a feature. Thus, in order not to keep the entry in the <em>a</em> feature, <param>valueFeatures</param> should be <em>[,b,c]</em>. In addition, the created annotations will have the feature keys and values defined in <param>constantAnnotationFeatures</param>.</p>
      <p>If specified, then <this/> assumes that <param>trieSource</param> contains a compiled version of the dictionary. <param>xlsFile</param> is not read. If specified, <this/> writes a compiled version of the dictionary in <param>trieSink</param>. The use of compiled dictionaries may accelerate the processing for large dictionaries.</p>
