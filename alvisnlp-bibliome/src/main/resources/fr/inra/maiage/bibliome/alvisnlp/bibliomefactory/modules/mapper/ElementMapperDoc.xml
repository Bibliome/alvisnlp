  <synopsis>
    <p>Maps elements according to a collection of mapping elements.</p>

    <description>
      <p><this/> evaluates <param>entries</param> as a list of elements with the corpus as the context element. These elements represent the entries from which target elements are matched. <param>key</param> specifies the key of each entry, and <param>values</param> specifies the values of the entries. <param>target</param> specifies the mapped elements; the <param>form</param> is matched against the key of entries. If the target element matches, <this/> adds the features <param>targetFeatures</param> with the matched entry values.</p>
