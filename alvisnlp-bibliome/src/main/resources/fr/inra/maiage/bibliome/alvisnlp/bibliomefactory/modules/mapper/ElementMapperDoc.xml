  <synopsis>
    <p>Maps elements according to a collection of mapping elements.</p>

    <description>
      <p><this/> evaluates <param name="entries"/> as a list of elements with the corpus as the context element. These elements represent the entries from which target elements are matched. <param name="key"/> specifies the key of each entry, and <param name="values"/> specifies the values of the entries. <param name="target"/> specifies the mapped elements; the <param name="form"/> is matched against the key of entries. If the target element matches, <this/> adds the features <param name="targetFeatures"/> with the matched entry values.</p>
