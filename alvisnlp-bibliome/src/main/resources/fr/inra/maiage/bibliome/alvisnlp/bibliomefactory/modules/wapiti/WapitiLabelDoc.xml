    <description>
      <p><this/> labels a sequence of tokens with a CRF model trained with <module>WapitiTrain</module>. The sequences are generated by annotations in <param>tokenLayerName</param> segmented with annotations in <param>sentenceLayerName</param>.</p>
      <p><param>features</param> must be the same as used in <module>WapitiTrain</module> but must not include the last one (that represents the label). The predicted label will be stored in the token feature <param>labelFeature</param>.</p>
