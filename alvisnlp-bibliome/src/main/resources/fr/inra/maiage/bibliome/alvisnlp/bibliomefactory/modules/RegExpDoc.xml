  <synopsis>
    <p>Matches a regular expression on sections contents and create an annotation for each match.</p>
  </synopsis>
  <module-doc>
    <description>
      <p><this/> searches for <param>pattern</param> in the contents of sections, then creates an annotation for each match. The created annotations will span on the entire match. The created annotations will be added in the layer named <param>targetLayerName</param> of the corresponding section. If <param>pattern</param> contains groups, then the pattern elements inside groups will be matched but the grouping will not be taken into account in the creation of the annotation.</p>
      <p>The created annotations will automatically have all features defined in <param>constantAnnotationFeatures</param>.</p>
