  <synopsis>
    <p>Read files in tree-tagger output format and creates a document for each file read.</p>
  </synopsis>

  <module-doc>
    <description>
      <p>Each document contains a single section named <param name="sectionName"/>; its contents is constructed by concatenating the first column of each token separated with a space character.</p>
      <p><this/> keeps the tree-tagger tokenization in annotations added into the layer <param name="wordLayerName"/>.
      The POS tag and lemma are recorded in the annotation's <param name="posFeatureKey"/> and <param name="lemmaFeatureKey"/> features respectively.</p>
      <p>The document identifier is the path of the corresponding file.</p>
