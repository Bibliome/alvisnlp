      <p><this/> hands the corpus to the <a href="http://search.cpan.org/~thhamon/Lingua-YaTeA">YaTeA</a> extractor. The corpus is first written in a file in the YaTeA input format. Tokens are annotations in the layer <param name="wordLayerName"/>, their surface form, POS tag and lemma are taken from <param name="formFeature"/>, <param name="posFeature"/> and <param name="lemmaFeature"/> features respectively. If <param name="sentenceLayerName"/> is set, then an additional <em>SENT</em> marker is added to reinforce sentence boundaries corresponding to annotations in this layer.</p>
      <p>The YaTeA is called using the executable set in <param name="yateaExecutable"/>, it will run as if it is called from directory <param name="workingDir"/>: the result will be written in the subdirectory named <param name="corpusName"/>.</p>
