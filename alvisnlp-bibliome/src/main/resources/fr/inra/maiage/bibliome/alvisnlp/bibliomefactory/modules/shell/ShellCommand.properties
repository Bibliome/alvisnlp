allow.usage = @allow add|remove|delete|args|features|create (documents|sections|annotations|relations|tuples|all)|everything
allow.help  = Allows action expressions in the following queries.

features.usage = @features [EXPR]
features.help = Evaluates the expression EXPR as a list of elements and prints all features of each element in the result. If EXPR is omitted, then prints all features of the current element.

help.usage = @help
help.help  = Prints this help.

move.usage = @move EXPR
move.help  = Evaluates the expression EXPR as a list of elements. If the result is not empty, then stacks the result and sets the current element to the first element in the result.

next.usage = @next
next.help  = Sets the current element to the next solution in the result of the last @move command. If the current element is the last element in the solution, the does nothing.

prev.usage = @next
prev.help  = Sets the current element to the previous solution in the result of the last @move command. If the current element is the first element in the solution, the does nothing.

query.usage = [@query] EXPR
query.help  = Evaluates the expression EXPR and prints the result.

ref.usage = @ref NAME EXPR
ref.help  = Evaluates the expression EXPR and assigns the result to the reference named NAME. The next query commands can access this reference with ref:NAME.

stack.usage = @stack
stack.help  = Prints the solutions and the current elements for each previous @move commands.

context.usage = @context
context.help  = Prints the current context state, including: references set with the ref command and action expressions allowed.

up.usage = @up
up.help  = Discards the solutions of the last @move command, re-loads the results of the preceding @move commands.
