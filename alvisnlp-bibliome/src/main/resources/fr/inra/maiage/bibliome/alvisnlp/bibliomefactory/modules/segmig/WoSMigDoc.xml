  <synopsis>
    <p>Performs word segmentation on section contents.</p>
  </synopsis>

  <module-doc>
    <description>
      <p><this/> searches for word boundaries in the section contents, creates an annotation for each word and adds it to the layer <param name="targetLayerName"/>. The following are considered as word boundaries:
      <ul>
	<li>consecutive whitespace characters, including ' ', newline, carriage return and horizontal tabulation;</li>
	<li>the positions before and after each punctuation character defined in <param name="punctuation"/> and <param name="balancedPunctuations"/>, thus a punctuation character always form a single-character word, a balanced punctuation breaks a word iff the corresponding punctuation is found.</li>
      </ul>
      </p>
      <p>If <param name="fixedFormLayerName"/> is defined then non-overlapping annotations in this layer will be added as is in <param name="targetLayerName"/>, the start and end positions of these annotations are considered as word boundaries and no word boundary is searched inside.</p>
      <p>The created annotations have the feature <param name="annotationTypeFeature"/> with a value corresponding to the word type:
      <ul>
	<li><strong>punctuation</strong>: if the word is a single-character punctuation;</li>
	<li><strong>word</strong>: if the word is a plain non-punctuation word.</li>
      </ul>
      The <param name="eosStatusFeature"/> feature contains the end-of-sentence status of the word:
      <ul>
	<li><strong>not-eos</strong>: if the word cannot be an end of sentence;</li>
	<li><strong>maybe-eos</strong>: if the word may be an end of sentence;</li>
	<li><strong>eos</strong>: if the word is definitely an end of sentence.</li>
      </ul>
