  <synopsis>
    <p>Performs word segmentation on section contents.</p>
  </synopsis>

  <module-doc>
    <description>
      <p><this/> searches for word boundaries in the section contents, creates an annotation for each word and adds it to the layer <param>targetLayer</param>. The following are considered as word boundaries:
      <ul>
	<li>consecutive whitespace characters, including ' ', newline, carriage return and horizontal tabulation;</li>
	<li>the positions before and after each punctuation character defined in <param>punctuations</param> and <param>balancedPunctuations</param>, thus a punctuation character always form a single-character word, a balanced punctuation breaks a word iff the corresponding punctuation is found.</li>
      </ul>
      </p>
      <p>If <param>fixedFormLayer</param> is defined then non-overlapping annotations in this layer will be added as is in <param>targetLayer</param>, the start and end positions of these annotations are considered as word boundaries and no word boundary is searched inside.</p>
      <p>The created annotations have the feature <param>annotationTypeFeature</param> with a value corresponding to the word type:
      <ul>
	<li><strong>punctuation</strong>: if the word is a single-character punctuation;</li>
	<li><strong>word</strong>: if the word is a plain non-punctuation word.</li>
      </ul>
