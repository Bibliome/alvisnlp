  <synopsis>
    <p>Converts into a data sink.</p>
  </synopsis>

  <converter-doc>
    <string-conversion>
      <p>The data source takes either the form of a file/directory path, or an URL. The following protocols are recognized:
      <ul>
	<li><em>file</em>: the data is written in the specified regular file path;</li>
	<li><em>stream</em>: the data is written to the AlvisNLP/ML standard output or error, the host part of the URI must be either "stdout" or "stderr" (<em>stream://stdout</em>);</li>
      </ul>
      If an absolute or relative path is specified, then <em>file</em> is assumed.
      Relative paths are relative to the current working directory.
      </p>
    </string-conversion>
  
    <xml-conversion>
      <p>
	<xverb><param value="URL"/></xverb>
	or
	<xverb><param file="URL"/></xverb>
	or
	<xverb><param path="URL"/></xverb>
	<em>URL</em> is converted as described in the string conversion.
	All different forms are equivalent; the name of the used attribute has no influence on the data source type.
	It is thus perfectly legal to write <xverb><param file="stream://stdout"/></xverb>.
	Two other attributes allow to control finely the data source:
	<ul>
	  <li><em>charset</em>: specifies the character encoding of the data ("UTF-8" by default);</li>
	  <li><em>encoding</em>: same as above;</li>
	</ul>
      </p>
      <p>If <xverb>param</xverb> has children elements, then each element will be converted as a data sink. The data will be duplicated into each data sink.</p>
