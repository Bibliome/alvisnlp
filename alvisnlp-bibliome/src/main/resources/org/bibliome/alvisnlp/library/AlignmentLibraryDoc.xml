<synopsis>
  <p><this/> provides functions to align two list of elements using the <a href="">Needleman-Wunsch</a> algorithm.</p>
</synopsis>

  <library-doc>
    <function-doc first-ftor="proba" synopsis="align:proba(gap, match, a, b)">
    	<p>Evaluates <em>a</em> and <em>b</em> as lists of elements and aligns them using the <a href="">Needleman-Wunsch</a> algorithm, then returns the optimal alignment probability.</p>
    	<p><em>gap</em> is evaluated as a number and specifies the gap penalty.</p>
    	<p><em>match</em> is evaluated as a number for each pair of elements. The context element is an item form <em>a</em> and the item from <em>b</em> can be retrieved with the function <em>other</em>.</p>
	</function-doc>

    <function-doc first-ftor="score" synopsis="align:score(gap, match, a, b)">
    	<p>This function aligns two lists. The difference from <em>align:proba</em> is that this function returns the alignment score.</p>
