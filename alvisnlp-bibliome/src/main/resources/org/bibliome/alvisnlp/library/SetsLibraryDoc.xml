    <function-doc first-ftor="union" synopsis="sets:union(a, b)">
      <p>Evaluates <em>a</em> and <em>b</em> as lists of elements, then returns the union of the results. The difference between this function and the union operator "|" is that this function removes duplicates.</p>

    <function-doc first-ftor="inter" synopsis="sets:inter(a, b)">
      <p>Evaluates <em>a</em> and <em>b</em> as lists of elements, then returns the intersection of the results.</p>
    </function-doc>

    <function-doc first-ftor="diff" synopsis="sets:diff(a, b)">
      <p>Evaluates <em>a</em> and <em>b</em> as lists of elements, then returns the elements in the former that are not in the latter.</p>
