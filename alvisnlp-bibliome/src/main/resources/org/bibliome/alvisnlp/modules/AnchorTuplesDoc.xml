  <synopsis>
    <p>Creates tuples with a common argument.</p>
  </synopsis>

  <module-doc>
    <description>
      <p><this/> evaluates <param name="anchor"/> as an element list with the corpus as the context element (see <converter name="alvisnlp.corpus.Expression"/>&gt;). For each anchor, <this/> creates a tuple in the relation named after <param name="relationName"/>, with the anchor as an argument with role <param name="anchorRole"/> and the first annotation in the result of each value of <param name="arguments"/> with the role of the corresponding key. <param name="arguments"/> values are evaluated as element lists with the anchor as the context element.</p>
