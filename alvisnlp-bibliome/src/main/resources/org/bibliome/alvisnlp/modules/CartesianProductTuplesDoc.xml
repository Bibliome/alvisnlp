  <synopsis>
    <p>Creates tuples for each element of a Cartesian product.</p>
  </synopsis>

  <module-doc>
    <description>
      <p><this/> evaluates <param name="anchor"/> as an element list with the corpus as the context element. Each item is hereby called the <em>anchor</em>. <this/> evaluates all values of <param name="arguments"/> as lists of elements with the anchor as the context element. Then it creates a tuple for each item of the cartesian product of the result of the evaluation of <param name="arguments"/>. The tuple will have an argument for each item with the role specified by the keys of <param name="arguments"/>.</p>
