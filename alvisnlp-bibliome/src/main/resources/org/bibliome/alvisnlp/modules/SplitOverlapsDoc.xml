  <module-doc>
    <description>
      <p><this/> copies annotations from <param name="checkedlayerNames"/> into <param name="modifiedlayerName"/> and ensures that this layer does not contain overlaping annotations. If <param name="checkedlayerNames"/> contains overlaps, then <this/> splits annotations at the start or end positions of overlapping annotations.</p>

	<li>Features copied?</li>
	<li>Non-split annotations deep-copied?</li>
	<li>Split embedded annotations?</li>
