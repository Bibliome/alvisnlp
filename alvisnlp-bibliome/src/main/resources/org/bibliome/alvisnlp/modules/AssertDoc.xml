  <synopsis>
    <p>Tests an assertion on specified elements.</p>
  </synopsis>

  <module-doc>
    <description>
      <p><this/> evaluates <param name="target"/> as a list of elements. Then, for each element, evaluates <param name="assertion"/> as a boolean. <this/> reports each element for which <param name="assertion"/> is <code>false</code>. <this/> aborts the processing of the corpus if <param name="severe"/> is <code>true</code>.</p>
    </description>
  
    <param-doc name="target">
      <p>Expression evaluated as a list of elements with the corpus as the context element. This parameter specifies the elements on which the assertion is checked.</p>
    </param-doc>
  
    <param-doc name="active">
      <p>An expression evaluated as a boolean with the corpus as the context element. This module processes the corpus if the result is <code>true</code></p>
    </param-doc>
  
    <param-doc name="assertion">
      <p>Expression evaluated as a boolean with the target element as the context element. This parameter specifies the assertion to be checked on each target.</p>
    </param-doc>
    
    <param-doc name="stopAt">
      <p>Maximum number of assertion failures before <this/> will stop checking.</p>
    </param-doc>
  
    <param-doc name="severe">
      <p>If <code>true</code> and there is at least one assertion failure, then <this/> will abort the processing of the corpus.</p>
    </param-doc>
    
    <param-doc name="userFunctions">
      <p>Set user functions available for this module. If this module is a sequence, then all compounds inherit its functions.</p>
    </param-doc>
    
    <param-doc name="message">
      <p>Customize the assertion failure message. This expression is evaluated as a string from the failed target.</p>
    </param-doc>
    
    <param-doc name="outFile">
      <p>Path to the file where to record assertion failures. If not set then assertion failures are not recorded, and only displayed on the log.</p>
    </param-doc>
