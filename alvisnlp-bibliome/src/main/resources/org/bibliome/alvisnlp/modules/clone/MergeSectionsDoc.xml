  <synopsis>
    <p>Merge several sections into a single one.</p>
  </synopsis>

  <module-doc>
    <description>
      <p><this/> creates a section named <param name="targetSectionName"/> that is a concatenation of all sections that satisfy <param name="sectionFilter"/>. Layers, annotations, relations and tuples of the source sections are copied to the new section. Additionally, <this/> can select or strip contents from annotations from <param name="fragmentLayerName"/>.</p>
    </description>

    <param-doc name="sectionSeparator">
      <p>Text to insert between the contents of the concatenated sections.</p>
    </param-doc>
  
    <param-doc name="active">
      <p>Expression evaluated as a boolean with the corpus as context element. If the result is false, then the module does not process the module.</p>

    <param-doc name="constantAnnotationFeatures">
      <p>Constant features to add to each annotation created by this module</p>
    </param-doc>
  
    <param-doc name="fragmentLayerName">
      <p>Name of the layer that contains annotations to include/exclude in/from the new section contents. If this parameter is not set, then <this/> concatenates the whole contents of the sections.</p>
    </param-doc>
  
    <param-doc name="targetSectionName">
      <p>Name of the section to create.</p>
    </param-doc>

      <p>Either to remove the sections that have been concatenated after the new section has been created.</p>

    <param-doc name="sectionsLayerName">
      <p>Name of the layer in the new section that contains annotations that have the span of the contents of the source sections. Each source section is represented by a distinct annotation. This annotations have the same features as the corresponding section (including <code>name</code>). If this parameter is not set, then <this/> does not create thses annotations.</p>

    <param-doc name="fragmentSelection">
      <p>If this parameter equals <code>include</code>, then <this/> only concatenates contents that is included in annotations in the layer <param name="fragmentLayerName"/>. If this parameter equals <code>exclude</code>, then <this/> only concatenates contents that is <em>not</em> included in annotations in the layer <param name="fragmentLayerName"/>. If <param name="fragmentLayerName"/> is not set, then this parameter is ignored.</p>
