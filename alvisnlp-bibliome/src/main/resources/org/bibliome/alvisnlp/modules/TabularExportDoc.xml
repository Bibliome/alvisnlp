      <p>
      	<this/> evaluates <param name="files"/> as a list of elements with the corpus as the context element and creates a file for each result.
      	The file is located in <param name="outDir"/> and named after the result of <param name="fileName"/> (evaluated as a string).
      </p>
      <p>
      	The file is a table where each line is the result of the evaluation of <param name="lines"/> as a list of element with the file element as the context element.
      	Each line will have as many columns as the size of the <param name="columns"/> array.
      </p>
      <p>
      	Each expression of <param name="columns"/> is evaluated as a string with the line element as the context element.
