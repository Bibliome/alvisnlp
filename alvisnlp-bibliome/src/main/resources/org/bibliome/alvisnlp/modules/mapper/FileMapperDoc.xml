  <synopsis>
    <p>Maps elements according to a tab-separated mapping file.</p>
  </synopsis>

  <module-doc>
    <description>
      <p><this/> reads the tab-separated mapping file <param name="mappingFile"/> and maps the elements specified by the expression <param name="target"/>. The mapping key of the elements is specified by the expression <param name="form"/> evaluated as a string with the element as the context. The key is mapped agains the column of <param name="mappingFile"/> specified by <param name="keyColumn"/> (starting at 0). Each feature in <param name="targetFeatures"/> is set with the value of the corresponding column in the matched line.</p>
