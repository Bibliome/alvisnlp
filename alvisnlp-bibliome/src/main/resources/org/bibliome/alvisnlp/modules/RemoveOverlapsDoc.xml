    <p>Removes overlapping annotations from a given layer.</p>
  </synopsis>

    <description>
      <p><this/> removes overlapping annotations in the layer <param name="layerName"/>.</p>
	  <p>
	  	<this/> scans each specified layer and finds clusters of overlapping annotations.
	  	<this/> distinguishes three overlapping situations:
	  	<ol>
	  	<li><em>equal</em>: two annotations have exactly the same span;</li>
	  	<li><em>included</em>: one annotation includes the other completely;</li>
	  	<li><em>overlapping</em>: one annotation overlaps with the head or the tail of the other annotation.</li>
	  	</ol>
	  </p>
	  <p>
	  <param name="removeEqual"/>, <param name="removeIncluded"/> and <param name="removeOverlapping"/> specify the behavior for each situation.
	  If the parameter is <code>true</code>, then <this/> will remove one of the annotations. 
	  </p>
	  <p>
	  <param name="annotationComparator"/> controls which annotation is removed.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	  By default <this/> removes all kinds of annotations, keeping the longest one.
