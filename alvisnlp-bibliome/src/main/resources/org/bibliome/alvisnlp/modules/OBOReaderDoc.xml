  <synopsis>
    <p>Reads terms in <a href="XXX">OBO files</a> as documents.</p>
  </synopsis>

    <description>
      <p>
      <this/> reads files specified by <param name="oboFiles"/> in <a href="XXX">OBO format</a>.
      Each term is loaded as a distinct document with the term identifier as the document identifier.
      Each document contains a section (<param name="nameSectionName"/>) containing the term name, and one section for each term synonym (<param name="synonymSectionName"/>).
      Optionally <this/> also sets features on the document with the term path from the root (<param name="pathFeature"/>), the identifier of the parent term (<param name="parentFeature"/>), the identifiers of each ancestor (<param name="ancestorsFeature"/>), of the identifiers of each child term (<param name="childrenFeature"/>).</p>
