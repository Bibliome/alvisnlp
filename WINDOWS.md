# Description

AlvisNLP is a configurable NLP batch processing pipeline. It annotates text documents for the semantic annotation of textual documents. It integrates Natural Language Processing (NLP) tools for sentence and word segmentation, named-entity recognition, term analysis, semantic typing and relation extraction. These tools rely on resources such as terminologies or ontologies for the adaptation to the application domain. Alvis NLP/ML contains several tools for (semi)-automatic acquisition of these resources, using Machine Learning (ML) techniques. New components can be easily integrated into the pipeline. Part of this work has been funded by the European project [Alvis](http://cordis.europa.eu/ist/kct/alvis_synopsis.htm) and the French project [Quaero](http://www.quaero.org/module_technologique/alvisae-alvis-annotation-editor/).


AlvisNLP is held by the [Bibliome group](http://maiage.jouy.inra.fr/?q=fr/bibliome/) at [Inra Jouy-en-Josas](http://www.jouy.inra.fr/en), France

# Prerequisites

* git
* Java >= 8
* Maven >= 3.0.5

## Java

The full JDK is necessary to install AlvisNLP.
There are instructions to [download and install JDK 8](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html).

Set the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable to the JDK directory, usually something like `C:\\Program Files\\jdk1.8.0_nnn`, where `nnn` is the update version of the JDK you downloaded.

You can set environment variables through the control panel, the exact procedure depends on the version of Windows.

## git

Instructions to [download and install git for windows](https://git-scm.com/download/win).

## Maven

[Download](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi) and [install](https://maven.apache.org/guides/getting-started/windows-prerequisites.html) Maven. Installing Maven means extracting the archive in a sensible place like your home or `Program Files`.

Set the `Path` environment variable to `%Path%;C:\\sensibleplace\\apache-maven-3.5.2\\bin`.

# Open a command-line console

The rest of the installation procedure is done through the command-line interface.
The `cmd.exe` tool is supported and tested.
There is a support for PowerShell, though it has not been thoroughly tested.

# Download

`git clone https://github.com/Bibliome/alvisnlp`

# Compile and build

`cd alvisnlp`

`mvn clean install`

# Command-line interface

## Install

### Host-specific parameter values

We recommend that you set default parameter values for your host.
These parameter values avoid to set parameters in plans for external tools.

`copy share\\default-param-values.xml.template share\\default-param-values.xml`

This will create a standard default parameter file in `share\\default-param-values.xml`.
Edit this file and fill parameter values appropriate for your host.

### Copy files to installation directory

`install.bat DIR`

`DIR` is the base directory of your AlvisNLP install.
This directory must exist.

If you are installing from PowerShell, run instead:

`install.ps1 DIR`

Note that the PowerShell `install.ps1` script has not been thoroughly tested.

## Running AlvisNLP

`DIR\\bin\\alvisnlp -help`

`DIR` is the base directory of your AlvisNLP install. You migh also add the `DIR/bin` sub-directory to your `Path` environment variable.
