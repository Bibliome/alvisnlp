We recommend you use the latest commit on the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Bibliome/alvisnlp).

The repository contains a `README` file that indicates the steps to downloading, installing and using AlvisNLP/ML on a linux system. If you are using a Windows system, check the `WINDOWS` file instead.
