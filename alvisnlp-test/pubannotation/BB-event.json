When biphenyl-grown cells were transferred back to a fructose medium, they required 25 generations for the membrane polarization and fatty acid compositions of these cells to revert back to those of the initial fructose-grown cells. The re-adaptation to a change in temperature required only five generations to return to normal.

To cleave the beta-1,4-linkages between beta-d-galactose and alpha-l-3,6-anhydro-galactose residues in the red algal galactans known as agars, marine bacteria produce polysaccharide hydrolases called beta-agarases. Beta-agarases A and B from Zobellia galactanivorans Dsij have recently been biochemically characterized. Here we report the first crystal structure of these two beta-agarases. The two proteins were overproduced in Escherichia coli and crystallized, and the crystal structures were determined at 1.48 and 2.3 A for beta-agarases A and B, respectively. The structure of beta-agarase A was solved by the multiple anomalous diffraction method, whereas beta-agarase B was solved with molecular replacement using beta-agarase A as model. Their structures adopt a jelly roll fold with a deep active site channel harboring the catalytic machinery, namely the nucleophilic residues Glu-147 and Glu-184 and the acid\/base residues Glu-152 and Glu-189 for beta-agarases A and B, respectively. The structures of the agarases were compared with those of two lichenases and of a kappa-carrageenase, which all belong to family 16 of the glycoside hydrolases in order to pinpoint the residues responsible for their widely differing substrate specificity. The relationship between structure and enzymatic activity of the two beta-agarases from Z. galactanivorans Dsij was studied by analysis of the degradation products starting with different oligosaccharides.

Previous transcriptome analysis identified a genome-wide regulon of putative virulence genes that are coexpressed with the TTS system. In this study, we characterized two of these genes, xopC and xopJ. Both genes encode Xanthomonas outer proteins (Xops) that were shown to be secreted by the TTS system. In addition, type III-dependent translocation of both proteins into the plant cell was demonstrated using the AvrBs3 effector domain as a reporter. XopJ belongs to the AvrRxv\/YopJ family of effector proteins from plant and animal pathogenic bacteria. By contrast, XopC does not share significant homology to proteins in the database. Sequence analysis revealed that the xopC locus contains several features that are reminiscent of pathogenicity islands. Interestingly, the xopC region is flanked by 62-bp inverted repeats that are also associated with members of the Xanthomonas avrBs3 effector family. Besides xopC, a second gene of the locus, designated hpaJ, was shown to be coexpressed with the TTS system. hpaJ encodes a protein with similarity to transglycosylases and to the Pseudomonas syringae pv. maculicola protein HopPmaG.

Escherichia coli O8:K88 to intestinal mucosa was studied on cultured Caco-2 cells and ex vivo on pigs' small intestinal tissue. Lactobacilli were added simultaneously with E. coli, before E. coli and after E. coli for competition, exclusion and displacement assays. The concentration of lactobacilli on fully differentiated Caco-2 cells was 4.5+\/-0.3 x 10(8) cfu\/well, while the concentration of E. coli varied from 1.5 x 10(6) to 4.3 x 10(8) cfu\/well. The number of E. coli adhered to Caco-2 monolayer (cfu\/well) was lineary correlated (R(2)=0.97) to the concentration of added cells. In the assay simulating exclusion, E. coli adhesion was reduced by Lb. gasseri K 7 strain by 0.1 to 0.6 log cfu\/well. The binding of E. coli was inhibited even more when incubated simultaneously with lactobacilli, particularly at the lowest concentration of E. coli (ratio E. coli\/lactobacilli 1:248), where five-times reduction (or 0.7 log) was observed. When adhesion to tissue derived from pigs' jejunum was tested, concentration of E. coli was constant (6.9+\/-0.14 x 10(7) cfu\/ml), while the concentration of Lb. gasseri K 7 was 5.9 x 10(7) and 1.3 x 10(7) cfu\/ml in two independent experiments, respectively.

No significant competition, exclusion or displacement of E. coli by lactobacilli was observed on jejunal tissue. In conclusion, Lb. gasseri K 7 was found to be effective in reducing E. coli adhesion to Caco-2 enterocytes, but it was not able to do so in ex vivo conditions tested for pig jejunal tissue.\n","relations":[{"pred":"Lives_In","obj":"10b9db7b","id":"ba54932","subj":"5ef6ae06"},{"pred":"Lives_In","obj":"9ef8eb7","id":"28975c28","subj":"5ef6ae06"},{"pred":"Lives_In","obj":"5b202a3a","id":"3943a2be","subj":"5ef6ae06"},{"pred":"Lives_In","obj":"34cdeda2","id":"343570b7","subj":"6e35bc3d"},{"pred":"Lives_In","obj":"6ee660fb","id":"157853da","subj":"6e35bc3d"},{"pred":"Lives_In","obj":"1f6c9cd8","id":"71c3b41","subj":"44b3606b"},{"pred":"Lives_In","obj":"5b619d14","id":"236e3f4e","subj":"44b3606b"},{"pred":"Lives_In","obj":"5b619d14","id":"3cc1435c","subj":"1477089c"},{"pred":"Lives_In","obj":"1f6c9cd8","id":"6bf0219d","subj":"1477089c"},{"pred":"Lives_In","obj":"54dcfa5a","id":"dd0c991","subj":"75cd8043"},{"pred":"Lives_In","obj":"28e8dde3","id":"5f16132a","subj":"75cd8043"},{"pred":"Lives_In","obj":"6d23017e","id":"69fb6037","subj":"75cd8043"}],"sourcedb":"BioNLP-ST-2016"},{"sourceid":"BB-event-16432479","denotations":[{"obj":"Bacteria","id":"1817f1eb","span":{"end":236,"begin":215}},{"obj":"Bacteria","id":"767e20cf","span":{"end":587,"begin":573}},{"obj":"Bacteria","id":"3a3e78f","span":{"end":983,"begin":969}},{"obj":"Bacteria","id":"301ec38b","span":{"end":1408,"begin":1394}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"17a1e4ca","span":{"end":420,"begin":408}}],"text":"Challenges in the control of gonorrhea in South America and the Caribbean: monitoring the development of resistance to antibiotics.\n: The objective of this study was to ascertain the antimicrobial susceptibility of Neisseria gonorrhoeae isolates from 6 South American and 13 Caribbean countries participating in the Gonococcal Antimicrobial Surveillance Program (GASP) from 1990 to 1999.\n: A GASP network of laboratories was launched in the Americas and the Caribbean during the 1990s.

We have exploited bioinformatics and experimental approaches to establish that the effector repertoire in the Sakai strain of enterohemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC) O157:H7 is much larger than previously thought. Homology searches led to the identification of >60 putative effector genes. Thirteen of these were judged to be likely pseudogenes, whereas 49 were judged to be potentially functional. In total, 39 proteins were confirmed experimentally as effectors: 31 through proteomics and 28 through translocation assays. At the protein level, the EHEC effector sequences fall into >20 families. The largest family, the NleG family, contains 14 members in the Sakai strain alone. EHEC also harbors functional homologs of effectors from plant pathogens (HopPtoH, HopW, AvrA) and from Shigella (OspD, OspE, OspG), and two additional members of the Map\/IpgB family. Genes encoding proven or predicted effectors occur in >20 exchangeable effector loci scattered throughout the chromosome. Crucially, the majority of functional effector genes are encoded by nine exchangeable effector loci that lie within lambdoid prophages.

In previous studies of S. marcescens MG1, we showed that biofilm maturation and sloughing were regulated by N-acyl homoserine lactone (AHL)-based quorum sensing (QS). Because of the importance of adhesion in initiating biofilm formation and infection, the primary goal of this study was to determine whether QS is important in adhesion to both abiotic and biotic surfaces, as assessed by determining the degree of attachment to hydrophilic tissue culture plates and human corneal epithelial (HCE) cells. Our results demonstrate that while adhesion to the abiotic surface was AHL regulated, adhesion to the HCE cell biotic surface was not. Type I fimbriae were identified as the critical adhesin for non-QS-mediated attachment to the biotic HCE cell surface but played no role in adhesion to the abiotic surface. While we were not able to identify a single QS-regulated adhesin essential for attachment to the abiotic surface, four AHL-regulated genes involved in adhesion to the abiotic surface were identified. Interestingly, two of these genes, bsmA and bsmB, were also shown to be involved in adhesion to the biotic surface in a non-QS-controlled fashion. Therefore, the expression of these two genes appears to be cocontrolled by regulators other than the QS system for mediation of attachment to HCE cells. We also found that QS in S. marcescens regulates other potential cell surface adhesins, including exopolysaccharide and the outer membrane protein OmpX. We concluded that S. marcescens MG1 utilizes different regulatory systems and adhesins in attachment to biotic and abiotic surfaces and that QS is a main regulatory pathway in adhesion to an abiotic surface but not in adhesion to a biotic surface.\n","relations":[{"pred":"Lives_In","obj":"3bcbb589","id":"482bce4f","subj":"542e560f"},{"pred":"Lives_In","obj":"3b00856b","id":"366647c2","subj":"626c44e7"},{"pred":"Lives_In","obj":"3016fd5e","id":"6a6afff2","subj":"626c44e7"},{"pred":"Lives_In","obj":"2807bdeb","id":"1649b0e6","subj":"1d730606"},{"pred":"Lives_In","obj":"18920cc","id":"865dd6","subj":"1d730606"},{"pred":"Lives_In","obj":"6ebf0f36","id":"4da4253","subj":"1d730606"},{"pred":"Lives_In","obj":"2e8e8225","id":"3972a855","subj":"1d730606"}],"sourcedb":"BioNLP-ST-2016"},{"sourceid":"BB-event-18845825","denotations":[{"obj":"Bacteria","id":"72c28d64","span":{"end":60,"begin":38}},{"obj":"Bacteria","id":"6492fab5","span":{"end":169,"begin":128}},{"obj":"Bacteria","id":"2c5529ab","span":{"end":390,"begin":386}},{"obj":"Bacteria","id":"39a8312f","span":{"end":432,"begin":428}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"5f6722d3","span":{"end":115,"begin":79}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"2c532cd8","span":{"end":115,"begin":100}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"294e5088","span":{"end":219,"begin":188}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"51972dc7","span":{"end":219,"begin":203}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"3700ec9c","span":{"end":470,"begin":452}}],"text":"High genetic diversity of nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae isolates from two children attending a day care center.\nTwenty-one nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae (NTHi) isolates from the throats of two healthy children were genotyped by multilocus sequence typing.

The quantitative real-time reverse transcription PCR analysis revealed a broad expression of MyD88 with the highest expression in the spleen and the weakest expression in the muscle. The expression of MyD88 after challenge with formalin-inactivated Gram-negative bacterium Vibrio parahaemolyticus was tested in blood, spleen and liver. It suggested that the highest expression was in the spleen (p<0.05) with 1.9 times (at 48 h) as much as that in the control and the lowest expression of MyD88 was in the liver (p<0.05) with 0.29 times (at 3h) of that in the control. These results indicated that as a universal key adaptor in the Toll-like receptor pathway in mammals, MyD88 might play an important role in large yellow croaker defense against pathogenic infection.\n","relations":[],"sourcedb":"BioNLP-ST-2016"},{"sourceid":"BB-event-19075662","denotations":[{"obj":"Bacteria","id":"57ea113a","span":{"end":42,"begin":28}},{"obj":"Bacteria","id":"acdb094","span":{"end":67,"begin":53}},{"obj":"Bacteria","id":"674bd420","span":{"end":246,"begin":220}},{"obj":"Bacteria","id":"2b0f373b","span":{"end":272,"begin":251}},{"obj":"Bacteria","id":"2ceb80a1","span":{"end":503,"begin":494}},{"obj":"Bacteria","id":"4b45dcb8","span":{"end":522,"begin":508}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"7216fb24","span":{"end":51,"begin":43}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"2072acb2","span":{"end":93,"begin":78}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"50ecde95","span":{"end":180,"begin":169}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"35a9782c","span":{"end":337,"begin":330}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"70a36a66","span":{"end":424,"begin":406}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"45815ffc","span":{"end":586,"begin":579}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"732f29af","span":{"end":804,"begin":797}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"d3957fe","span":{"end":865,"begin":838}}],"text":"Prevention and treatment of Staphylococcus biofilms.\nStaphylococcus growth on medical devices represents a common occurrence that can lead to serious illness and death.

In addition to Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Mycoplasma pneumoniae described previously, five other pathogens, Neisseria meningitidis, Escherichia coli, Streptococcus agalactiae, Staphylococcus aureus, and Listeria monocytogenes, were targeted, based on a large-scale surveillance in Japan. Results in CSF from neonates and children (n=150), and from adults (n=18) analyzed by real-time PCR with molecular beacon probes were compared with those of conventional culturing. The total time from DNA extraction from CSF to PCR analysis was 1.5 h. The limit of detection for these pathogens ranged from 5 copies to 28 copies per tube. Nonspecific positive reactions were not recognized for 37 microorganisms in clinical isolates as a negative control. The pathogens were detected in 72.0% of the samples by real-time PCR, but in only 48.2% by culture, although the microorganisms were completely concordant. With the real-time PCR, the detection rate of H. influenzae from CSF was high, at 45.2%, followed by S. pneumoniae (21.4%), S. agalactiae (2.4%), E. coli (1.8%), L. monocytogenes (0.6%), and M. pneumoniae (0.6%). The detection rate with PCR was significantly better than that with cultures in patients with antibiotic administration (chi2=18.3182; P=0.0000).

As a result, for many pathogenic bacteria, Fur plays a crucial role in the course of infection and disease development. In this study, the fur gene was cloned from a pathogenic Pseudomonas fluorescens strain, TSS, isolated from diseased Japanese flounder cultured in a local farm. TSS Fur can partially complement the defective phenotype of an Escherichia coli fur mutant. A TSS fur null mutant, TFM, was constructed. Compared to TSS, TFM exhibits reduced growth ability, aberrant production of outer membrane proteins, decreased resistance against host serum bactericidal activity, impaired ability to disseminate in host blood and tissues, and drastic attenuation in overall bacterial virulence in a Japanese flounder infection model. When used as a live vaccine administered via the injection, immersion, and oral routes, TFM affords high levels of protection upon Japanese flounder against not only P. fluorescens infection but also Aeromonas hydrophila infection. Furthermore, a plasmid, pJAQ, was constructed, which expresses the coding element of the Vibrio harveyi antigen AgaV-DegQ. TFM harboring pJAQ can secret AgaV-DegQ into the extracellular milieu.

Schwann cells, the glial cells of the PNS, by interacting with neuronal (axonal) ligands, mainly neuregulins via receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) complex, ErbB2\/ErbB3, initiate intracellular signaling pathways to drive proliferation and differentiation of Schwann cells, both during development and the process of regeneration and re-myelination after nerve injury. One of the major signaling kinases, extracellular signal-regulated kinase-1\/2 (ERK1\/2), that is also a downstream signaling pathway of neuregulin-ErbB2\/ErbB3 activation, has been identified as a key regulator of Schwann cell proliferation, differentiation, demyelination and nerve regeneration. Recent studies have provided evidence that the bacterium that causes human leprosy, Mycobacterium leprae that has a unique capacity to invade Schwann cells of the adult PNS, utilizes the neuregulin-ErbB2\/ErbB3 associated signaling network to the bacterial advantage. M. leprae directly bind to ErbB2 on myelinated Schwann cells and activate the RTK by a novel route that bypasses the classical neuregulin\/growth factor-induced ErbB2-ErbB3 heterodimerization, and subsequently induce downstream the canonical Erk1\/2 signaling, leading to myelin breakdown and subsequent axonal damage. This initial injury provides a survival advantage for M. leprae as it induces de-differentiation and generates myelin-free cells, which are highly susceptible to M. leprae invasion and promote bacterial survival. Once invaded M. leprae activate Erk1\/2 via a non-canonical pathway and subsequently increase the cell proliferation and maintain the infected cells in de-differentiated state, thereby preventing remyelination. Therefore, by subverting major RTKs and signaling pathways in adult Schwann cells M. leprae appear to propagate the bacterial niche and maintain survival within the PNS. These studies may also provide new insights into our understanding of signaling mechanisms involve in both neurodegeneration and neuroregeneration.\n","relations":[{"pred":"Lives_In","obj":"7e276594","id":"22ef9844","subj":"6f2cfcc2"},{"pred":"Lives_In","obj":"655ef322","id":"6283d8b8","subj":"6f2cfcc2"},{"pred":"Lives_In","obj":"73173f63","id":"3b6ddd1d","subj":"6f2cfcc2"},{"pred":"Lives_In","obj":"55562aa9","id":"3f6b0be5","subj":"6f2cfcc2"},{"pred":"Lives_In","obj":"4233e892","id":"611889f4","subj":"ccb4b1b"},{"pred":"Lives_In","obj":"3ecd267f","id":"1da2cb77","subj":"4097cac"},{"pred":"Lives_In","obj":"6bb2d00b","id":"48f278eb","subj":"ec2cc4"}],"sourcedb":"BioNLP-ST-2016"},{"sourceid":"BB-event-20073421","denotations":[{"obj":"Bacteria","id":"3c9bfddc","span":{"end":97,"begin":71}},{"obj":"Bacteria","id":"1a9c38eb","span":{"end":162,"begin":140}},{"obj":"Bacteria","id":"319bc845","span":{"end":317,"begin":300}},{"obj":"Bacteria","id":"4c5474f5","span":{"end":412,"begin":405}},{"obj":"Bacteria","id":"2f4205be","span":{"end":582,"begin":569}},{"obj":"Bacteria","id":"54e22bdd","span":{"end":701,"begin":688}},{"obj":"Bacteria","id":"3bd418e4","span":{"end":852,"begin":839}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"544820b7","span":{"end":138,"begin":101}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"6b98a075","span":{"end":118,"begin":101}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"2e61d218","span":{"end":107,"begin":101}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"3569fc08","span":{"end":190,"begin":185}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"20b12f8a","span":{"end":262,"begin":251}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"e84a8e1","span":{"end":256,"begin":251}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"2e554a3b","span":{"end":358,"begin":328}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"54a67a45","span":{"end":338,"begin":328}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"7d42c224","span":{"end":466,"begin":456}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"56aaaecd","span":{"end":742,"begin":728}}],"text":"The effect of interferon-gamma and lipopolysaccharide on the growth of Francisella tularensis LVS in murine macrophage-like cell line J774.\nFrancisella tularensis, a causative agent of human tularemia, displaying the ability to proliferate inside the human cells.\nTo evaluate the growth potential of F. tularensis LVS strain in macrophage-like cell line J774 modulated by recombinant interferon gamma and E. coli derived lipopolysaccharide.\nStimulation of J774 cells either by interferon-gamma or lipopolysaccharide alone, or especially in combination before infection F. tularensis, revealed protective effects.

Previously, it has been shown that the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or free lipid A of V. fischeri can trigger morphological changes in the juvenile squid's light organ that occur upon colonization. To investigate the structural features that might be responsible for this phenomenon, the lipid A from V. fischeri ES114 LPS was isolated and characterized by multistage mass spectrometry (MS(n)). A microheterogeneous mixture of mono- and diphosphorylated diglucosamine disaccharides was observed with variable states of acylation ranging from tetra- to octaacylated forms. All lipid A species, however, contained a set of conserved primary acyl chains consisting of an N-linked C14:0(3-OH) at the 2-position, an unusual N-linked C14:1(3-OH) at the 2'-position, and two O-linked C12:0(3-OH) fatty acids at the 3- and 3'-positions. The fatty acids found in secondary acylation were considerably more variable, with either a C12:0 or C16:1 at the 2-position, C14:0 or C14:0(3-OH) at the 2'-position, and C12:0 or no substituent at the 3'-position. Most surprising was the presence of an unusual set of modifications at the secondary acylation site of the 3-position consisting of phosphoglycerol (GroP), lysophosphatidic acid (GroP bearing C12:0, C16:0, or C16:1), or phosphatidic acid (GroP bearing either C16:0 + C12:0 or C16:0 + C16:1).

The antibody detection showed a high positive predictive value (90.7%) and a high negative predictive value (83.3%).\nThe antibody detection by protein array, especially the detection of anti-Ure antibody combined with anti-CagA antibody, is valuable in the diagnosis of H.pylori infection.\n","relations":[{"pred":"Lives_In","obj":"3f390d63","id":"23c30a20","subj":"2371aaca"},{"pred":"Lives_In","obj":"1506f20f","id":"1e1a0406","subj":"63fdab07"},{"pred":"Lives_In","obj":"14dda234","id":"3cebbb30","subj":"17cdf2d0"}],"sourcedb":"BioNLP-ST-2016"},{"sourceid":"BB-event-22834551","denotations":[{"obj":"Bacteria","id":"47a5b70d","span":{"end":125,"begin":102}},{"obj":"Bacteria","id":"424fd310","span":{"end":320,"begin":290}},{"obj":"Bacteria","id":"1a45193b","span":{"end":1315,"begin":1301}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"38f116f6","span":{"end":29,"begin":14}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"5286c33a","span":{"end":40,"begin":33}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"6e6d5d29","span":{"end":78,"begin":57}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"5c530d1e","span":{"end":67,"begin":57}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"6c25e6c4","span":{"end":226,"begin":185}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"85e6769","span":{"end":226,"begin":205}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"c5ee75e","span":{"end":249,"begin":235}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"48a12036","span":{"end":373,"begin":365}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"bf1ec20","span":{"end":470,"begin":449}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"70efb718","span":{"end":463,"begin":455}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"b70da4c","span":{"end":541,"begin":498}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"4a11eb84","span":{"end":541,"begin":520}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"4e858e0a","span":{"end":534,"begin":526}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"435fb7b5","span":{"end":580,"begin":573}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"4e70a728","span":{"end":631,"begin":611}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"b7838a9","span":{"end":622,"begin":617}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"696f0212","span":{"end":646,"begin":642}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"5733f295","span":{"end":662,"begin":658}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"1c3146bc","span":{"end":748,"begin":744}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"56c698e3","span":{"end":805,"begin":801}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"47a86fbb","span":{"end":825,"begin":818}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"f478a81","span":{"end":903,"begin":899}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"19553973","span":{"end":949,"begin":944}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"7bb6ab3a","span":{"end":993,"begin":977}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"7fe7c640","span":{"end":1139,"begin":1118}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"4c4748bf","span":{"end":1132,"begin":1124}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"7ce97ee5","span":{"end":1188,"begin":1160}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"32c8e539","span":{"end":1188,"begin":1180}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"73dce0e6","span":{"end":1243,"begin":1235}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"5a85c92","span":{"end":1277,"begin":1261}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"32811494","span":{"end":1300,"begin":1290}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"4795ded0","span":{"end":1388,"begin":1364}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"53dacd14","span":{"end":1380,"begin":1364}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"14d14731","span":{"end":1483,"begin":1439}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"2eced48b","span":{"end":1483,"begin":1467}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"47c4ecdc","span":{"end":1541,"begin":1517}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"42f33b5d","span":{"end":1582,"begin":1546}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"5c8504fd","span":{"end":1582,"begin":1562}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"4b7e96a","span":{"end":1573,"begin":1568}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"6475472c","span":{"end":1649,"begin":1610}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"3f07b12c","span":{"end":1649,"begin":1641}}],"text":"The effect of Artemisia annua on broiler performance, on intestinal microbiota and on the course of a Clostridium perfringens infection applying a necrotic enteritis disease model.\nThe aerial parts of the plant Artemisia annua contain essential oils having antimicrobial properties against Clostridium perfringens Type A, the causal agent for necrotic enteritis in broilers. In two experiments, the influence of increasing dietary concentrations of dried A. annua leaves (0, 5, 10 and 20 g\/kg) and n-hexane extract from fresh A. annua leaves (0, 125, 250 and 500 mg\/kg) on broiler performance was investigated.

The n-hexane extract also reduced feed intake, but broiler weight tended to decrease only at the highest dietary concentration. The feed conversion ratio tended to improve when birds received 250 and 500 mg\/kg n-hexane extract. In a third experiment, a necrotic enteritis disease model was applied to investigate the effect of the dietary addition of dried A. annua leaves (10 g\/kg on top) or n-hexane extract of A. annua (250 mg\/kg) on the severity of the disease in broilers. The addition of n-hexane extract reduced the intestinal C. perfringens numbers and the severity of the disease-related small intestinal lesions. Over the infection period from day 17 to day 27, birds supplemented with the n-hexane extract gained more weight than both the challenged control birds and birds receiving dried plant material. The results indicate that n-hexane extracts derived from A. annua can modulate the course of necrotic enteritis and compensate to a certain extent for the disease-associated weight losses.\n","relations":[{"pred":"Lives_In","obj":"32811494","id":"4310d43","subj":"1a45193b"}],"sourcedb":"BioNLP-ST-2016"},{"sourceid":"BB-event-23702192","denotations":[{"obj":"Bacteria","id":"4bd1f8dd","span":{"end":88,"begin":67}},{"obj":"Bacteria","id":"7096b474","span":{"end":121,"begin":100}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"3e14c16d","span":{"end":278,"begin":273}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"3c989952","span":{"end":492,"begin":407}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"784b990c","span":{"end":511,"begin":500}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"3d3ba765","span":{"end":586,"begin":550}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"25bc0606","span":{"end":671,"begin":652}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"5d1659ea","span":{"end":928,"begin":907}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"793138bd","span":{"end":919,"begin":907}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"1951b871","span":{"end":978,"begin":968}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"5c18016b","span":{"end":1157,"begin":1134}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"33aeca0b","span":{"end":1370,"begin":1360}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"43aaf813","span":{"end":1397,"begin":1388}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"57ac5227","span":{"end":1436,"begin":1431}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"4ba302e0","span":{"end":1654,"begin":1646}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"e98770d","span":{"end":1796,"begin":1786}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"1ae67cad","span":{"end":1813,"begin":1800}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"2f6e28bc","span":{"end":1833,"begin":1828}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"7c098bb3","span":{"end":1867,"begin":1855}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"31e4bb20","span":{"end":1862,"begin":1855}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"18cebaa5","span":{"end":2010,"begin":1989}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"463b4ac8","span":{"end":2001,"begin":1989}}],"text":"Clinical factors associated with development of severe-complicated Clostridium difficile infection.\nClostridium difficile infection (CDI) can cause life-threatening complications.

One cohort comprised all hospitalized patients; the other comprised a subset of these inpatients who were residents of Olmsted County, Minnesota to assess the association of comorbid conditions with the development of severe-complicated infection in a population-based cohort. The linear combinations of variables identified by using logistic regression models provided scores to predict the risk of developing severe-complicated CDI.\nIn a multivariable model that included all inpatients, increasing age, leukocyte count >15 × 10(9)\/L, increase in serum level of creatinine >1.5-fold from baseline, and use of proton pump inhibitors or narcotic medications were independently associated with severe-complicated CDI. In the secondary analysis, which included only patients from Olmsted County, comorbid conditions were not significantly associated with severe-complicated CDI.\nOlder age, high numbers of leukocytes in blood samples, an increased serum level of creatinine, gastric acid suppression, and use of narcotic medications were independently associated with development of severe-complicated CDI in hospitalized patients.

In this study the antimicrobial susceptibility of isolates from a UK-wide survey of Campylobacter in retail poultry in 2001 and 2004-5 was investigated. The occurrence of phenotypes resistant to tetracycline, quinolones (ciprofloxacin and naladixic acid), erythromycin, chloramphenicol and aminoglycosides was quantified. This was compared with a phylogeny for these isolates based upon Multi Locus Sequence Typing (MLST) to investigate the pattern of antimicrobial resistance acquisition.\nAntimicrobial resistance was present in all lineage clusters, but statistical testing showed a non-random distribution. Erythromycin resistance was associated with Campylobacter coli. For all antimicrobials tested, resistant isolates were distributed among relatively distant lineages indicative of widespread acquisition. There was also evidence of clustering of resistance phenotypes within lineages; indicative of local expansion of resistant strains.\nThese results are consistent with the widespread acquisition of antimicrobial resistance among chicken associated Campylobacter isolates, either through mutation or horizontal gene transfer, and the expansion of these lineages as a proportion of the population. As Campylobacter are not known to multiply outside of the host and long-term carriage in humans is extremely infrequent in industrialized countries, the most likely location for the proliferation of resistant lineages is in farmed chickens.\n","relations":[{"pred":"Lives_In","obj":"4409e975","id":"242b836","subj":"765f05af"},{"pred":"Lives_In","obj":"5c153b9e","id":"3f6f6701","subj":"62f68dff"},{"pred":"Lives_In","obj":"2a7686a7","id":"3527942a","subj":"62f68dff"},{"pred":"Lives_In","obj":"758a34ce","id":"942a29c","subj":"62f68dff"},{"pred":"Lives_In","obj":"7ec3394b","id":"5a45133e","subj":"f001896"},{"pred":"Lives_In","obj":"bff34c6","id":"534a5a98","subj":"1d0d6318"},{"pred":"Lives_In","obj":"312ab28e","id":"4f80542f","subj":"4bc28c33"},{"pred":"Lives_In","obj":"1522d8a0","id":"60bd273d","subj":"4bc28c33"}],"sourcedb":"BioNLP-ST-2016"},{"sourceid":"BB-event-23908036","denotations":[{"obj":"Bacteria","id":"5644dc81","span":{"end":101,"begin":79}},{"obj":"Bacteria","id":"246f8b8b","span":{"end":125,"begin":103}},{"obj":"Bacteria","id":"278bb07e","span":{"end":391,"begin":373}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"4351c8c3","span":{"end":221,"begin":198}}],"text":"Preliminary X-ray crystallographic analysis of β-carbonic anhydrase psCA3 from Pseudomonas aeruginosa.\nPseudomonas aeruginosa is a Gram-negative bacterium that causes life-threatening infections in susceptible individuals and is resistant to most clinically available antimicrobials.

The morphology of Φ st1 showed strong resemblance to members of the Siphoviridae family. Φ st1 was observed to be a DNA phage with an estimated genome size of 121 kbp. It was found to be able to infect S. Typhimurium and S. Hadar, with a stronger lytic activity against the former. Subsequent characterisation of Φ st1 against S.

Time to clearance of colonization has important implications for patient care and infection control policy.\nWe performed parallel searches in OVID Medline for studies that reported the time to documented clearance of MRSA and VRE colonization in the absence of treatment, published between January 1990 and July 2012.\nFor MRSA, we screened 982 articles, identified 16 eligible studies (13 observational studies and 3 randomized controlled trials), for a total of 1,804 non-duplicated subjects. For VRE, we screened 284 articles, identified 13 eligible studies (12 observational studies and 1 randomized controlled trial), for a total of 1,936 non-duplicated subjects. Studies reported varying definitions of clearance of colonization; no study reported time of initial colonization. Studies varied in the frequency of sampling, assays used for sampling, and follow-up period. The median duration of total follow-up was 38 weeks for MRSA and 25 weeks for VRE. Based on pooled analyses, the model-estimated median time to clearance was 88 weeks after documented colonization for MRSA-colonized patients and 26 weeks for VRE-colonized patients. In a secondary analysis, clearance rates for MRSA and VRE were compared by restricting the duration of follow-up for the MRSA studies to the maximum observed time point for VRE studies (43 weeks). With this restriction, the model-fitted median time to documented clearance for MRSA would occur at 41 weeks after documented colonization, demonstrating the sensitivity of the pooled estimate to length of study follow-up.\nFew available studies report the natural history of MRSA and VRE colonization. Lack of a consistent definition of clearance, uncertainty regarding the time of initial colonization, variation in frequency of sampling for persistent colonization, assays employed and variation in duration of follow-up are limitations of the existing published literature. The heterogeneity of study characteristics limits interpretation of pooled estimates of time to clearance, however, studies included in this review suggest an increase in documented clearance over time, a result which is sensitive to duration of follow-up.\n","relations":[{"pred":"Lives_In","obj":"3dd1dc90","id":"f78a47e","subj":"78fbff54"},{"pred":"Lives_In","obj":"3dd1dc90","id":"644baf4a","subj":"7e22550a"},{"pred":"Lives_In","obj":"abf688e","id":"7526515b","subj":"7516e4e5"},{"pred":"Lives_In","obj":"478ee483","id":"1ed4ae0f","subj":"488eb7f2"}],"sourcedb":"BioNLP-ST-2016"},{"sourceid":"BB-event-24831788","denotations":[{"obj":"Bacteria","id":"1a7288a3","span":{"end":1042,"begin":1020}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"2974f221","span":{"end":96,"begin":81}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"58fe0499","span":{"end":207,"begin":203}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"686449f9","span":{"end":312,"begin":308}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"665df3c6","span":{"end":498,"begin":494}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"68b6f0d6","span":{"end":724,"begin":704}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"4044fb95","span":{"end":719,"begin":704}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"aa549e5","span":{"end":1071,"begin":1062}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"36f48b4","span":{"end":1377,"begin":1373}}],"text":"Evaluation of impermeant, DNA-binding dye fluorescence as a real-time readout of eukaryotic cell toxicity in a high throughput screening format.\nInterpretation of high throughput screening (HTS) data in cell-based assays may be confounded by cytotoxic properties of screening compounds. Therefore, assessing cell toxicity in real time during the HTS process itself would be highly advantageous. Here, we investigate the potential of putatively impermeant, fluorescent, DNA-binding dyes to give cell toxicity readout during HTS. Amongst 19 DNA-binding dyes examined, three classes were identified that were (1) permeant, (2) cytotoxic, or (3) neither permeant nor cytotoxic during 3-day incubation with a macrophage cell line. In the last class, four dyes (SYTOX Green, CellTox Green, GelGreen, and EvaGreen) gave highly robust cytotoxicity data in 384-well screening plates. As proof of principle, successful combination with a luminescence-based assay in HTS format was demonstrated. Here, both intracellular growth of Legionella pneumophila (luminescence) and host cell viability (SYTOX Green exclusion) were assayed in the same screening well. Incorporation of membrane-impermeant, DNA-binding, fluorescent dyes in HTS assays should prove useful by allowing evaluation of cytotoxicity in real time, eliminating reagent addition steps and effort associated with endpoint cell viability analysis, and reducing the need for follow-up cytotoxicity screening.\n","relations":[{"pred":"Lives_In","obj":"aa549e5","id":"78e4deb0","subj":"1a7288a3"}],"sourcedb":"BioNLP-ST-2016"},{"sourceid":"BB-event-25098305","denotations":[{"obj":"Bacteria","id":"5c00384f","span":{"end":63,"begin":53}},{"obj":"Bacteria","id":"3b7ff809","span":{"end":496,"begin":476}},{"obj":"Bacteria","id":"1bb564e2","span":{"end":523,"begin":501}},{"obj":"Bacteria","id":"62e6b5c8","span":{"end":652,"begin":640}},{"obj":"Bacteria","id":"3f792b9b","span":{"end":841,"begin":827}},{"obj":"Bacteria","id":"7b8233cd","span":{"end":1186,"begin":1172}},{"obj":"Bacteria","id":"4b20ca2b","span":{"end":1341,"begin":1329}},{"obj":"Bacteria","id":"1cbf6e72","span":{"end":1360,"begin":1346}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"6aecbb8d","span":{"end":40,"begin":17}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"1af146","span":{"end":96,"begin":67}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"4da602fc","span":{"end":117,"begin":98}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"2a8d39c4","span":{"end":168,"begin":145}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"25b2cfcb","span":{"end":206,"begin":191}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"72758afa","span":{"end":227,"begin":208}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"fb9c7aa","span":{"end":432,"begin":399}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"4c398c80","span":{"end":606,"begin":578}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"7fc6de5b","span":{"end":934,"begin":925}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"21baa903","span":{"end":1027,"begin":1018}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"607fbe09","span":{"end":1095,"begin":1086}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"60a2630a","span":{"end":1147,"begin":1138}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"29df4d43","span":{"end":1283,"begin":1267}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"5dd91bca","span":{"end":1415,"begin":1376}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"40cb698e","span":{"end":1663,"begin":1643}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"3382f8ae","span":{"end":1741,"begin":1732}}],"text":"Surveillance for upper respiratory tract disease and Mycoplasma in free-ranging gopher tortoises (Gopherus polyphemus) in Georgia, USA.\nAbstract Upper respiratory tract disease (URTD) in the gopher tortoise (Gopherus polyphemus) is highly contagious and has been implicated in the reduction of populations throughout the range. With the exception of a few limited studies, the prevalence of URTD in Georgia, USA tortoise populations is poorly known. We found that exposure to Mycoplasma agassizii and Mycoplasma testudineum, associated with URTD, varied geographically among 11 Georgia tortoise populations. The prevalence of antibodies to M. agassizii in individual populations was either very low (0-3%, n=7 populations) or very high (96-100%, n=4 populations), whereas there was variation in the prevalence of antibodies to M. testudineum among populations (20-61%, n=10) with only one site being negative. Five sites had tortoises with antibodies to both pathogens, and these were the only sites where we observed tortoises with clinical signs consistent with URTD. We did not find tortoises with clinical signs of URTD at sites with tortoises with antibodies only to M. testudineum, which provides evidence that this organism may be of limited pathogenicity for gopher tortoises. Collectively, these data indicate that both M. agassizii and M. testudineum are present in Georgia populations of gopher tortoises and that clinical disease is apparent in populations where both pathogens are present. Additional research is needed to better understand the role of these two pathogens, and other potential pathogens, in the overall health of tortoise populations, especially if future conservation efforts involve translocation of tortoises.\n","relations":[{"pred":"Lives_In","obj":"4da602fc","id":"76b1e9b8","subj":"5c00384f"},{"pred":"Lives_In","obj":"1af146","id":"27406a17","subj":"5c00384f"},{"pred":"Lives_In","obj":"4c398c80","id":"248e319b","subj":"3b7ff809"},{"pred":"Lives_In","obj":"4c398c80","id":"3e8c3cb","subj":"1bb564e2"},{"pred":"Lives_In","obj":"5dd91bca","id":"543295b0","subj":"4b20ca2b"},{"pred":"Lives_In","obj":"5dd91bca","id":"54422e18","subj":"1cbf6e72"}],"sourcedb":"BioNLP-ST-2016"},{"sourceid":"BB-event-25562320","denotations":[{"obj":"Bacteria","id":"60641ec8","span":{"end":92,"begin":66}},{"obj":"Bacteria","id":"75f65e45","span":{"end":485,"begin":459}},{"obj":"Bacteria","id":"6eeade6c","span":{"end":490,"begin":487}},{"obj":"Bacteria","id":"4a891c97","span":{"end":754,"begin":751}},{"obj":"Bacteria","id":"a5bd950","span":{"end":791,"begin":788}},{"obj":"Bacteria","id":"4d18aa28","span":{"end":896,"begin":893}},{"obj":"Bacteria","id":"75390459","span":{"end":1027,"begin":1024}},{"obj":"Bacteria","id":"7756c3cd","span":{"end":1108,"begin":1105}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"2313052e","span":{"end":21,"begin":19}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"2bd2b28e","span":{"end":139,"begin":124}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"16746061","span":{"end":186,"begin":183}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"57fd91c9","span":{"end":564,"begin":562}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"6cfcd46d","span":{"end":619,"begin":616}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"52045dbe","span":{"end":669,"begin":667}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"674658f7","span":{"end":723,"begin":700}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"5c8eee0f","span":{"end":820,"begin":809}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"565b064f","span":{"end":938,"begin":893}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"26425897","span":{"end":917,"begin":893}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"73163d48","span":{"end":926,"begin":906}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"58c34bb3","span":{"end":911,"begin":906}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"56a4479a","span":{"end":1147,"begin":1145}}],"text":"Annexin1 regulates DC efferocytosis and cross-presentation during Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection.\nThe phagocytosis of apoptotic cells and associated vesicles (efferocytosis) by DCs is an important mechanism for both self tolerance and host defense. Although some of the engulfment ligands involved in efferocytosis have been identified and studied in vitro, the contributions of these ligands in vivo remain ill defined. Here, we determined that during Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infection, the engulfment ligand annexin1 is an important mediator in DC cross-presentation that increases efferocytosis in DCs and intrinsically enhances the capacity of the DC antigen-presenting machinery. Annexin1-deficient mice were highly susceptible to Mtb infection and showed an impaired Mtb antigen-specific CD8+ T cell response. Importantly, annexin1 expression was greatly downregulated in Mtb-infected human blood monocyte-derived DCs, indicating that reduction of annexin1 is a critical mechanism for immune evasion by Mtb. Collectively, these data indicate that annexin1 is essential in immunity to Mtb infection and mediates the power of DC efferocytosis and cross-presentation. \n","relations":[{"pred":"Lives_In","obj":"26425897","id":"663c9e7a","subj":"4d18aa28"},{"pred":"Lives_In","obj":"58c34bb3","id":"19e4653c","subj":"4d18aa28"}],"sourcedb":"BioNLP-ST-2016"},{"sourceid":"BB-event-25634638","denotations":[{"obj":"Bacteria","id":"62163b39","span":{"end":98,"begin":76}},{"obj":"Bacteria","id":"20a8a64e","span":{"end":200,"begin":178}},{"obj":"Bacteria","id":"62f4ff3b","span":{"end":215,"begin":202}},{"obj":"Bacteria","id":"1698fc68","span":{"end":681,"begin":668}},{"obj":"Bacteria","id":"4504d271","span":{"end":862,"begin":849}},{"obj":"Bacteria","id":"207b8649","span":{"end":1004,"begin":984}},{"obj":"Bacteria","id":"65b3a85a","span":{"end":1139,"begin":1111}},{"obj":"Bacteria","id":"34997338","span":{"end":1164,"begin":1141}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"57eda880","span":{"end":488,"begin":480}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"2b5825fa","span":{"end":517,"begin":501}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"53d1b9b3","span":{"end":612,"begin":584}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"2cae1042","span":{"end":612,"begin":590}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"163d04ff","span":{"end":612,"begin":601}}],"text":"Real-time monitoring of hydrogen cyanide (HCN) and ammonia (NH\u2083) emitted by Pseudomonas aeruginosa.\nWe present the real-time monitoring of hydrogen cyanide (HCN) production from Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa) strains in vitro, using laser-based photoacoustic spectroscopy.

In our determination of its antibacterial potency against various clinical isolates obtained from clinical materials (amniotic fluid, intrauterine secretions, exudates of the pelvic dead space) of patients with various infections, we obtained results representing specific features of this drug. From the results, the drug may be expected to produce an excellent effect in the treatment of various infections. Our study on drug concentrations in body fluids and genital tissues demonstrated a good transfer of this drug into various tissues; in every tissue examined, the drug administered by the usual method in the usual dose yielded a concentration exceeding MIC for principal pathogens, thus promising a good clinical response. Indeed a high clinical efficacy rate of 90.1% (good to very good responses) was obtained in a clinical trial involving 222 cases. Administration of the drug in 2 g quantity daily produced a high response rate of 92.8%. It was especially noteworthy that a good response was obtained in 30 of 32 cases (93.8%) in which other cephem compounds had failed. In evaluation of the bacteriological effect, furthermore, the drug showed an excellent rate of bacterial elimination. In conclusion, this drug is expected to be greatly useful in the light of its good transfer into genital tissues and its strong antibacterial activities against Gram-positive cocci, Gram-negative bacteria and anaerobes as well as against multiple bacterial infections predominating among women with genital infections.\n","relations":[],"sourcedb":"BioNLP-ST-2016"},{"sourceid":"BB-event-4105033","denotations":[{"obj":"Bacteria","id":"14b030a0","span":{"end":80,"begin":58}},{"obj":"Bacteria","id":"41e350f1","span":{"end":160,"begin":138}},{"obj":"Bacteria","id":"422c3c7a","span":{"end":1306,"begin":1293}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"18230356","span":{"end":562,"begin":533}}],"text":"Interactions of alkaline phosphatase and the cell wall of Pseudomonas aeruginosa.\nSpheroplasts prepared by lysozyme treatment of cells of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, suspended in 20% sucrose or 0.2 m MgCl(2), were examined in detail. Preparation of spheroplasts in the presence of 0.2 m Mg(2+) released periplasmic alkaline phosphatase, whereas preparation in the presence of 20% sucrose did not, even though untreated cells released phosphatase when suspended in sucrose in the absence of lysozyme. Biochemical characterizations of the sucrose-lysozyme preparations indicated that lysozyme mediated a reassociation of the released phosphatase with the spheroplasts. In addition, the enzyme released from whole cells suspended in 20% sucrose (which represents 20 to 40% of the cell-bound phosphatase) reassociates with the cells in the presence of lysozyme. Electron microscopic examinations of various preparations revealed that phosphatase released in sucrose reassociated with the external cell wall layers in the presence of lysozyme, that sucrose-lysozyme prepared spheroplasts did not dissociate phosphatase which remained in the periplasm of sucrose-washed cells, and that phosphatase was never observed to be associated with the cytoplasmic membrane. A model to account for the binding of P. aeruginosa alkaline phosphatase to the internal portion of the tripartite layer of the cell wall rather than to the cytoplasmic membrane or peptidoglycan layer is presented.\n","relations":[],"sourcedb":"BioNLP-ST-2016"},{"sourceid":"BB-event-4328756","denotations":[{"obj":"Bacteria","id":"d8305c2","span":{"end":33,"begin":16}},{"obj":"Bacteria","id":"56bca85b","span":{"end":102,"begin":85}},{"obj":"Bacteria","id":"75d0911a","span":{"end":324,"begin":313}},{"obj":"Bacteria","id":"75e91545","span":{"end":358,"begin":347}},{"obj":"Bacteria","id":"60d1a32f","span":{"end":861,"begin":850}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"531c311e","span":{"end":102,"begin":60}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"22b53226","span":{"end":333,"begin":313}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"1fcb4808","span":{"end":389,"begin":373}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"726e5805","span":{"end":633,"begin":604}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"40c80397","span":{"end":633,"begin":615}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"4b672daa","span":{"end":793,"begin":764}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"ea9b7c6","span":{"end":793,"begin":775}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"e077866","span":{"end":869,"begin":850}}],"text":"Biochemistry of Coxiella burnetii: Embden-Meyerhof pathway.\nPurified preparations of Coxiella burnetii were examined for enzymes of the glycolytic pathway.

In a group of 17 patients with duodenal ulcers the authors investigated the effect of omeprazole on (1) healing of duodenal ulcers and bulbitis after 2-4 weeks of therapy, (2) elimination of Helicobacter pylori in the antrum, (3) chronic antral gastritis. Ad 1. After two weeks of treatment the authors found that 5 of 17 chronic duodenal ulcers were healed in the remainder substantial regression was found. Four-week treatment led to healing of 16 from a total of 17 ulcers (P < 0.001), i. e. 94%.

To address the presence of gamma delta T cells within the BCG granulomas, we have characterized the TCR phenotype of T-lymphocytes present in the BCG granulomatous lesion immunohistochemically using a monoclonal antibody to TCR delta 1 and others. Fairly large numbers of gamma delta T cells were located at the periphery of the BCG granulomas without necrosis and most of them also expressed CD8.

The rolB gene of the TL-DNA is the major factor in the pathogenesis of the hairy-root disease and its constitutive expression interfere profoundly with plant morphogenesis. We have tested whether the expression of its sequence related putative homologue from the TR-DNA (rolBTR) may cause also bacterial virulence or affect plant development. Unlike rolB, rolBTR is unable to induce root formation on tobacco leaf discs. Tobacco plants expressing a chimeric 35S::rolBTR gene have reduced stature, off-shoots at the stem base and bent and wrinkled leaves with epinastic growth. 14 N-terminal amino acids which are absent in the rolB protein are indispensable to rolBTR protein activity. The characteristic tyrosine phosphatase super family motif CX5R is absent in the rolBTR protein. For rolB this motif is possibly functionally relevant.

Percentage of neutrophils containing alkaline phosphatase and intensity of NAP activity were measured. Preinfection percentage of neutrophils with enzyme activity varied between 64.0% and 84.4% and the intensity of enzyme activity was low in all cows. After induction of infection, percentage of neutrophils with enzyme activity showed a significant decrease on day 1 followed by an significant increase on day 3. NAP intensity increased significantly on the second and third day after infection. This increase of intensity was significantly, positively correlated with the severity of infection. From this study we may conclude that variation in susceptibility to E. coli mastitis could not be explained by preinfection NAP levels. The post-infection increase of NAP activity, that was found following an induced infection was more a result of increased enzyme intensity per neutrophil, then from an increase of percentage neutrophils with enzyme activity. Furthermore, a strong correlation was found between NAP intensity and severity of inflammation. There was evidence that the more severely diseased animals showed stronger NAP intensity increase.\n","relations":[{"pred":"Lives_In","obj":"83298d7","id":"1e16c0aa","subj":"773f7880"},{"pred":"Lives_In","obj":"4c51bb7","id":"13d73f29","subj":"65a4798f"}],"sourcedb":"BioNLP-ST-2016"},{"sourceid":"BB-event-9798026","denotations":[{"obj":"Bacteria","id":"350ec41e","span":{"end":43,"begin":24}},{"obj":"Bacteria","id":"69637b10","span":{"end":545,"begin":526}},{"obj":"Bacteria","id":"71984c3","span":{"end":685,"begin":676}},{"obj":"Bacteria","id":"165b2f7f","span":{"end":840,"begin":831}},{"obj":"Bacteria","id":"5536379e","span":{"end":1170,"begin":1161}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"277f7dd3","span":{"end":93,"begin":86}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"6c8bca63","span":{"end":158,"begin":109}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"2364305a","span":{"end":216,"begin":209}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"470a696f","span":{"end":285,"begin":235}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"1bc715b8","span":{"end":318,"begin":297}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"292d1c71","span":{"end":399,"begin":392}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"2b491fee","span":{"end":428,"begin":421}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"3f1c5af9","span":{"end":513,"begin":505}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"1c55f277","span":{"end":611,"begin":604}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"5ddabb18","span":{"end":641,"begin":616}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"3e8f7922","span":{"end":733,"begin":705}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"63192798","span":{"end":938,"begin":931}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"50eca7c6","span":{"end":1032,"begin":1021}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"58e6d4b8","span":{"end":1078,"begin":1071}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"1de5f0ef","span":{"end":1091,"begin":1083}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"376a312c","span":{"end":1143,"begin":1136}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"28d6290","span":{"end":1248,"begin":1205}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"6ca0256d","span":{"end":1248,"begin":1205}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"5ef0d29e","span":{"end":1278,"begin":1271}}],"text":"Previous infection with Helicobacter pylori is the primary determinant of spontaneous gastric hypoacidity in human immunodeficiency virus-infected outpatients.\nTo investigate the incidence and demographics of gastric hypoacidity among persons infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), 146 asymptomatic subjects were evaluated with use of a radiotelemetry device (Heidelberg capsule).

Multivariate analysis indicated that a positive H. pylori serology was the most significant predictor of hypoacidity, accounting for an increase in gastric pH of 39%. A history of injection drug use, heterosexual transmission of HIV, and male gender were also associated with an elevated gastric pH. CD4 cell counts did not contribute to predictions of gastric pH.

The presence of monoclonal B cells in Helicobacter pylori-chronic active gastritis has suggested that polymerase chain reaction (PCR) data should be viewed with caution. We investigated the reliability of PCR versus immunophenotyping in diagnosing early gastric MALT lymphoma. We studied 1511 biopsies from eight patients with high-grade primary gastric lymphoma, 25 with low-grade MALT lymphoma, 32 with atypical lymphoid infiltrates, and 39 with Helicobacter pylori-chronic active gastritis. Paraffin sections from all cases were stained with antibodies to CD20, CD3, AE1\/AE3, kappa and lambda. PCR was performed on paraffin sections using the primer set VH-FR3\/J(H). Using histopathology as the gold standard in diagnosis, we confirmed monoclonality in 22 of 25 MALT lymphomas (88%); a clonal band was found in 38% (15 of 39) of patients with chronic active gastritis. An immunophenotype pattern with predominance of CD20-positive cells in lymphocytic infiltrates was associated with monoclonality in 92% of cases. The presence of an enlarged irregular mantle zone was found in both monoclonal and polyclonal areas. An equal prevalence of B and T cells in lymphocytic infiltrates was associated with a polyclonal pattern in 24 of 31 cases (77%). Immunostaining of sIg (kappa and lambda) was difficult in paraffin sections and convincing proof of monoclonality was not obtained. Lymphoepithelial lesions were infrequent in gastric biopsies and their presence was highlighted with keratin stains. Because monoclonal B cells are observed in Helicobacter pylori-associated gastritis, the correct interpretation of clonality by PCR remains unclear. Paraffin section IHC using CD20 and CD3 is especially useful to confirm the diagnosis of gastric MALT lymphoma.\n","relations":[{"pred":"Lives_In","obj":"2cac4385","id":"24959ca4","subj":"51850751"}],"sourcedb":"BioNLP-ST-2016"},{"sourceid":"BB-event-11989773","denotations":[{"obj":"Bacteria","id":"2c7d121c","span":{"end":70,"begin":58}},{"obj":"Bacteria","id":"65aa6596","span":{"end":97,"begin":75}},{"obj":"Bacteria","id":"67389cb8","span":{"end":289,"begin":277}},{"obj":"Bacteria","id":"419a20a6","span":{"end":316,"begin":294}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"533377b","span":{"end":134,"begin":103}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"3383649e","span":{"end":117,"begin":103}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"10fde30a","span":{"end":110,"begin":103}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"f27ea3","span":{"end":490,"begin":477}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"1ce61929","span":{"end":481,"begin":477}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"346939bf","span":{"end":541,"begin":510}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"4bf3798b","span":{"end":524,"begin":510}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"58670130","span":{"end":677,"begin":662}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"74e47444","span":{"end":685,"begin":679}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"9bd0fa6","span":{"end":690,"begin":687}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"59d2103b","span":{"end":700,"begin":696}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"39dcf4b0","span":{"end":1056,"begin":1041}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"6e4de19b","span":{"end":1099,"begin":1087}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"f6c03cb","span":{"end":1091,"begin":1087}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"46f699d5","span":{"end":1213,"begin":1200}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"18518ccf","span":{"end":1204,"begin":1200}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"1991f767","span":{"end":1242,"begin":1227}}],"text":"Evaluation of two commercial methods for the detection of Listeria sp. and Listeria monocytogenes in a chicken nugget processing plant.\nThis study measures the detection performances of two rapid test systems (Listeria Rapid Test Clearview and Bax system) for the screening of Listeria sp. and Listeria monocytogenes, respectively.

We have reported that the grade of atrophy was higher in H. pylori-positive subjects than in H. pylori-negative subjects. It has also been reported that the atrophy of gastric mucosa increased in H. pylori-infected monkeys compared with control monkeys in a 5-year follow-up study. Most H. pylori infections occur in children, and atrophy of the gastric mucosa progresses during aging. Long-term data show that H. pylori infection can lead to gastric atrophy and may play an important role in the development of gastric cancer. Interestingly, there was no difference in the prevalence of H. pylori between patients with chronic gastritis and gastric cancer in Japan, but the prevalence of H. pylori in young Japanese gastric cancer patients was significantly higher than in the control group. These data clearly show that H. pylori infection is one of the risk factors of gastric cancer in young Japanese people, There is no answer to whether curing H. pylori infection can reverse the atrophy of the gastric mucosa and decrease the risk of gastric cancer development.

This study showed that the Israeli spotted fever group isolates (from both ticks and humans) were genetically homogeneous by the criteria used in this study, despite the time and location differences in their original isolation, and different as a group from R. conorii.\n","relations":[{"pred":"Lives_In","obj":"63648ee9","id":"47c81abf","subj":"5bf22f18"},{"pred":"Lives_In","obj":"68d6972f","id":"776a6d9b","subj":"267f474e"},{"pred":"Lives_In","obj":"63648ee9","id":"1f760b47","subj":"267f474e"},{"pred":"Lives_In","obj":"6d366c9b","id":"18ece7f4","subj":"28276e50"},{"pred":"Lives_In","obj":"45be7cd5","id":"33f676f6","subj":"28276e50"},{"pred":"Lives_In","obj":"7651218e","id":"264f218","subj":"28276e50"},{"pred":"Lives_In","obj":"5b58ed3c","id":"3576ddc2","subj":"741b3bc3"},{"pred":"Lives_In","obj":"24faea88","id":"2e570ded","subj":"741b3bc3"}],"sourcedb":"BioNLP-ST-2016"},{"sourceid":"BB-event-14633026","denotations":[{"obj":"Bacteria","id":"3a320ade","span":{"end":72,"begin":36}},{"obj":"Bacteria","id":"64beebb7","span":{"end":240,"begin":185}},{"obj":"Bacteria","id":"7813cb11","span":{"end":330,"begin":319}},{"obj":"Bacteria","id":"bcec031","span":{"end":402,"begin":386}},{"obj":"Bacteria","id":"21005f6c","span":{"end":685,"begin":674}},{"obj":"Bacteria","id":"32f0fba8","span":{"end":843,"begin":827}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"545de5a4","span":{"end":481,"begin":459}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"29ef6856","span":{"end":936,"begin":919}}],"text":"Characterization of a mosquitocidal Bacillus thuringiensis serovar sotto strain isolated from Okinawa, Japan.\nTo characterize the mosquitocidal activity of parasporal inclusions of the Bacillus thuringiensis serovar sotto strain 96-OK-85-24, for comparison with two well-characterized mosquitocidal strains.\nThe strain 96-OK-85-24 significantly differed from the existing mosquitocidal B. thuringiensis strains in: (1) lacking the larvicidal activity against Culex pipiens molestus and haemolytic activity, and (2) SDS-PAGE profiles, immunological properties and N-terminal amino acid sequences of parasporal inclusion proteins.\nIt is clear from the results that the strain 96-OK-85-24 synthesizes a novel mosquitocidal Cry protein with a unique toxicity spectrum.\nThis is the first report of the occurrence of a mosquitocidal B. thuringiensis strain with an unusual toxicity spectrum, lacking the activity against the culicine mosquito.\n","relations":[{"pred":"Lives_In","obj":"545de5a4","id":"51bf5add","subj":"bcec031"}],"sourcedb":"BioNLP-ST-2016"},{"sourceid":"BB-event-15293611","denotations":[{"obj":"Bacteria","id":"ab7a938","span":{"end":40,"begin":18}},{"obj":"Bacteria","id":"3faf2e7d","span":{"end":154,"begin":132}},{"obj":"Bacteria","id":"4648ce9","span":{"end":411,"begin":398}},{"obj":"Bacteria","id":"569bf9eb","span":{"end":668,"begin":655}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"61526469","span":{"end":86,"begin":44}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"274872f8","span":{"end":54,"begin":44}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"76ba13c","span":{"end":86,"begin":59}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"eb6449b","span":{"end":64,"begin":59}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"7c351808","span":{"end":184,"begin":158}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"180e6ac4","span":{"end":263,"begin":257}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"42b64ab8","span":{"end":316,"begin":297}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"7e985ce9","span":{"end":369,"begin":331}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"2a39fe6a","span":{"end":369,"begin":331}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"410ae9a3","span":{"end":350,"begin":340}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"319988b0","span":{"end":360,"begin":355}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"d5ae57e","span":{"end":585,"begin":579}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"68759011","span":{"end":612,"begin":604}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"7e242b4d","span":{"end":627,"begin":621}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"305f031","span":{"end":692,"begin":684}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"592e843a","span":{"end":742,"begin":734}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"1d1f7216","span":{"end":790,"begin":783}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"423e4cbb","span":{"end":806,"begin":798}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"6e16b8b5","span":{"end":847,"begin":839}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"43b4fe19","span":{"end":993,"begin":985}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"25ddbbbb","span":{"end":1049,"begin":1045}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"1536602f","span":{"end":1185,"begin":1177}}],"text":"Clonal strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa in paediatric and adult cystic fibrosis units.\nDespite recent reports of clonal strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa in cystic fibrosis (CF) units, the need for routine microbiological surveillance remains contentious.

All P. aeruginosa isolates were typed using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. Spirometry, anthropometrics, hospitalisations and antibiotic sensitivity data were recorded. The first 100 sputum samples (first 50 patients at each clinic) harboured 163 isolates of P. aeruginosa. A total of 39 patients shared a common strain (pulsotype 2), 20 patients shared a strain with at least one other patient and 41 patients harboured unique strains. Eight patients shared a strain identical to a previously reported Australian transmissible strain (pulsotype 1). Compared with the unique strain group, patients harbouring pulsotype 2 were younger and had poorer lung function. Treatment requirements were similar in these two groups, as were the rates of multiresistance. In conclusion, 59% of patients harboured a clonal strain, supporting the need for routine microbiological surveillance. In contrast to previously described clonal strains, the dominant pulsotype was indistinguishable from nonclonal strains with respect to both colonial morphology and multiresistance. The clinical significance of clonal strains remains uncertain and requires longitudinal study.\n","relations":[{"pred":"Lives_In","obj":"76ba13c","id":"77659b30","subj":"ab7a938"},{"pred":"Lives_In","obj":"61526469","id":"456d6c1e","subj":"ab7a938"},{"pred":"Lives_In","obj":"7c351808","id":"1e13529a","subj":"3faf2e7d"},{"pred":"Lives_In","obj":"180e6ac4","id":"1ec9bd38","subj":"4648ce9"},{"pred":"Lives_In","obj":"42b64ab8","id":"452e19ca","subj":"4648ce9"},{"pred":"Lives_In","obj":"1d1f7216","id":"3cfdd820","subj":"569bf9eb"},{"pred":"Lives_In","obj":"423e4cbb","id":"928763c","subj":"569bf9eb"},{"pred":"Lives_In","obj":"305f031","id":"e25951c","subj":"569bf9eb"},{"pred":"Lives_In","obj":"592e843a","id":"15f47664","subj":"569bf9eb"},{"pred":"Lives_In","obj":"6e16b8b5","id":"471a9022","subj":"569bf9eb"},{"pred":"Lives_In","obj":"43b4fe19","id":"dc9876b","subj":"569bf9eb"},{"pred":"Lives_In","obj":"d5ae57e","id":"2f666ebb","subj":"569bf9eb"},{"pred":"Lives_In","obj":"1536602f","id":"19976a65","subj":"569bf9eb"},{"pred":"Lives_In","obj":"68759011","id":"a1f72f5","subj":"569bf9eb"}],"sourcedb":"BioNLP-ST-2016"},{"sourceid":"BB-event-15618837","denotations":[{"obj":"Bacteria","id":"4ebea12c","span":{"end":33,"begin":14}},{"obj":"Bacteria","id":"2a1edad4","span":{"end":182,"begin":163}},{"obj":"Bacteria","id":"6256ac4f","span":{"end":450,"begin":441}},{"obj":"Bacteria","id":"44c79f32","span":{"end":527,"begin":518}},{"obj":"Bacteria","id":"7fcbe147","span":{"end":635,"begin":626}},{"obj":"Bacteria","id":"235f4c10","span":{"end":731,"begin":722}},{"obj":"Bacteria","id":"743cb8e0","span":{"end":826,"begin":817}},{"obj":"Bacteria","id":"c7a975a","span":{"end":1101,"begin":1092}},{"obj":"Bacteria","id":"2c1b9e4b","span":{"end":1388,"begin":1379}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"757d6814","span":{"end":214,"begin":196}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"649725e3","span":{"end":358,"begin":327}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"3c0fae6c","span":{"end":377,"begin":371}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"4c168660","span":{"end":409,"begin":393}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"52b56a3e","span":{"end":537,"begin":504}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"fd0e5b6","span":{"end":1420,"begin":1402}}],"text":"Recurrence of Helicobacter pylori infection 1 year after successful treatment: prospective cohort study in the Republic of Yemen.\nTo investigate the prevalence of Helicobacter pylori infection in dyspeptic patients in the Republic of Yemen and the recurrence rate 1 year after apparently successful eradication.\nA total of 275 patients with chronic dyspepsia seen in one clinic were enrolled. Gastric biopsies were obtained at endoscopy and H. pylori infection was diagnosed using the rapid urease test. Patients with H. pylori infection were given either clarithromycin or metronidazole-based triple therapy. Six weeks later H. pylori status was assessed using the C-urea breath test (C-UBT).

The overall eradication rate 6 weeks after treatment was 49.1% (95% CI 42.6-55.6%) by intention-to-treat analysis, and 60% (95% CI 53-67%) by per-protocol analysis. Recurrence rate of H. pylori infection at 1 year was 34% (95% CI 14-45%) and the only predictor of recurrence was an excess delta C-UBT value less than 3.5 per million but equal to or greater than 2.5 per million at 6 weeks after treatment (odds ratio 2.28; 95% CI 1.17-4.44; P = 0.028).\nThe prevalence of H. pylori infection in dyspeptic patients in Yemen is very high, the eradication rate with standard triple therapy was unsatisfactory probably because of widespread bacterial resistance due to unrestricted antibiotic use.

The identification of pathogens was carried out by the conventional methods in combination with ELISA, immunoseparation, and PCR. The antibiotic susceptibility was determined by MIC following the NCCLS recommendations.\nOf those with diarrhea, 40.9% were less than one year old and 71.0% were less than two years old. A potential pathogen was identified in 67.3% of children with diarrhea. They were group A rotavirus, diarrheagenic Escherichia coli, Shigella spp, and enterotoxigenic Bacteroides fragilis, with prevalences of 46.7%, 22.5%, 4.7%, and 7.3%, respectively. No Salmonella spp or Vibrio cholerae were isolated. Rotavirus and diarrheagenic E. coli were predominant in children less than two years of age, while Shigella spp, and enterotoxigenic B. fragilis were mostly seen in the older children. Diarrheagenic E. coli and Shigella spp showed high prevalence of resistance to ampicillin, chloramphenicol, and to trimethoprim\/sulfamethoxazole. Children attending the hospitals had fever (43.6%), vomiting (53.8%), and dehydration (82.6%). Watery stool was predominant with a prevalence of 66.4%, followed by mucous stool (21.0%). The mean episodes of stools per day was seven, ranging from two to 23 episodes. Before attending hospitals, 162\/587 (27.6%) children had been given antibiotics. Overall, more children got diarrhea in (i) poor families; (ii) families where piped water and a latrine were lacking; (iii) families where mothers washed their hands less often before feeding the children; (iv) families where mothers had a low level of education; (v) families where information on health and sanitation less often reached their households.\nGroup A rotavirus, diarrheagenic Escherichia coli, Shigella spp, and enterotoxigenic Bacteroides fragilis play an important role in causing diarrhea in children in Hanoi, Vietnam. Epidemiological factors such as lack of fresh water supply, unhygienic septic tank, low family income, lack of health information, and low educational level of parents could contribute to the morbidity of diarrhea in children.\n","relations":[{"pred":"Lives_In","obj":"3f2ef586","id":"6aa8e115","subj":"7e809b79"},{"pred":"Lives_In","obj":"3f2ef586","id":"5e21e98f","subj":"5cc126dc"},{"pred":"Lives_In","obj":"3f2ef586","id":"51a9ad5e","subj":"625e134e"},{"pred":"Lives_In","obj":"751d3241","id":"5f20155b","subj":"5dbe30be"},{"pred":"Lives_In","obj":"76c7beb3","id":"72ade7e3","subj":"4fe89c24"},{"pred":"Lives_In","obj":"76c7beb3","id":"239105a8","subj":"55795845"},{"pred":"Lives_In","obj":"18a3962d","id":"609bcfb6","subj":"1a1da881"},{"pred":"Lives_In","obj":"18a3962d","id":"23202fce","subj":"5b970f7"},{"pred":"Lives_In","obj":"18a3962d","id":"7b993c65","subj":"7fd4acee"}],"sourcedb":"BioNLP-ST-2016"},{"sourceid":"BB-event-16514151","denotations":[{"obj":"Bacteria","id":"4215838f","span":{"end":690,"begin":674}},{"obj":"Bacteria","id":"452ba1db","span":{"end":1343,"begin":1336}},{"obj":"Bacteria","id":"2289aca5","span":{"end":1410,"begin":1387}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"76a36b71","span":{"end":821,"begin":810}}],"text":"Hg(II) sequestration and protection by the MerR metal-binding domain (MBD).\nMerR, the metalloregulator of the bacterial mercury resistance (mer) operon, binds Hg(II) with high affinity. To study the mechanism of metal-induced activation, a small protein was previously engineered embodying in a single polypeptide the metal-binding domain (MBD) ordinarily formed between two monomers of MerR. Here the physiological and biochemical properties of MBD expressed on the cell surface or in the cytosol were examined, to better understand the environments in which specific metal binding can occur with this small derivative. Over 20 000 surface copies of MBD were expressed per Escherichia coli cell, with metal stoichiometries of approximately 1.0 Hg(II) per MBD monomer. Cells expressing MBD on their surface in rich medium bound 6.1-fold more Hg(II) than those not expressing MBD. Although in nature cells use the entire mer operon to detoxify mercury, it was interesting to note that cells expressing only MBD survived Hg(II) challenge and recovered more quickly than cells without MBD. Cell-surface-expressed MBD bound Hg(II) preferentially even in the presence of a 22-fold molar excess of Zn(II) and when exposed to equimolar Cd(II) in addition. MBD expressed in the cystosol also afforded improved survival from Hg(II) exposure for E. coli and for the completely unrelated bacterium Deinococcus radiodurans.\n","relations":[],"sourcedb":"BioNLP-ST-2016"},{"sourceid":"BB-event-18094887","denotations":[{"obj":"Bacteria","id":"184497d1","span":{"end":10,"begin":0}},{"obj":"Bacteria","id":"f9d87b","span":{"end":105,"begin":94}},{"obj":"Bacteria","id":"6ffab045","span":{"end":628,"begin":612}},{"obj":"Bacteria","id":"26fb628","span":{"end":652,"begin":642}},{"obj":"Bacteria","id":"3e2943ab","span":{"end":701,"begin":684}},{"obj":"Bacteria","id":"70dd7e15","span":{"end":799,"begin":788}},{"obj":"Bacteria","id":"4a9f80d3","span":{"end":895,"begin":885}},{"obj":"Bacteria","id":"35beb15e","span":{"end":919,"begin":906}},{"obj":"Bacteria","id":"41fe9859","span":{"end":931,"begin":921}},{"obj":"Bacteria","id":"5ac86ba5","span":{"end":941,"begin":933}},{"obj":"Bacteria","id":"6c67e137","span":{"end":956,"begin":947}},{"obj":"Bacteria","id":"2c9399a4","span":{"end":1024,"begin":1011}},{"obj":"Bacteria","id":"191ae03f","span":{"end":1098,"begin":1087}},{"obj":"Bacteria","id":"9635fa","span":{"end":1192,"begin":1179}},{"obj":"Bacteria","id":"53ab0286","span":{"end":1298,"begin":1288}},{"obj":"Bacteria","id":"63c5efee","span":{"end":1390,"begin":1377}},{"obj":"Bacteria","id":"2d10e0b1","span":{"end":1405,"begin":1395}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"1c98290c","span":{"end":126,"begin":119}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"172ca72b","span":{"end":134,"begin":128}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"5bda80bf","span":{"end":141,"begin":136}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"71e5f61d","span":{"end":152,"begin":147}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"2ce86164","span":{"end":214,"begin":210}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"5e8f9e2d","span":{"end":259,"begin":224}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"51df223b","span":{"end":288,"begin":261}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"fd46303","span":{"end":306,"begin":290}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"60d8c0dc","span":{"end":325,"begin":308}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"4204541c","span":{"end":352,"begin":327}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"6a62689d","span":{"end":370,"begin":354}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"4602c2a9","span":{"end":395,"begin":372}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"60fa3495","span":{"end":427,"begin":401}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"3e2822","span":{"end":443,"begin":439}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"79e18e38","span":{"end":473,"begin":453}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"29a60c27","span":{"end":495,"begin":475}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"1849db1a","span":{"end":516,"begin":497}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"69c79f09","span":{"end":534,"begin":518}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"1ca25c47","span":{"end":564,"begin":540}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"5fcacc0","span":{"end":590,"begin":586}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"533b266e","span":{"end":596,"begin":592}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"6d1d4d7","span":{"end":610,"begin":602}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"89ff02e","span":{"end":674,"begin":669}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"6865c751","span":{"end":736,"begin":731}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"62679465","span":{"end":766,"begin":745}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"6a988392","span":{"end":751,"begin":745}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"1d71006f","span":{"end":766,"begin":755}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"5b6813df","span":{"end":760,"begin":755}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"5f2606b","span":{"end":834,"begin":813}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"2b58f754","span":{"end":819,"begin":813}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"3ebff828","span":{"end":834,"begin":824}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"2552f2cb","span":{"end":829,"begin":824}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"33352f32","span":{"end":999,"begin":964}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"5f3b9c57","span":{"end":971,"begin":964}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"1e044120","span":{"end":999,"begin":973}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"2cf23c81","span":{"end":976,"begin":973}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"3624da92","span":{"end":999,"begin":978}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"35fe2125","span":{"end":983,"begin":978}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"94f6bfb","span":{"end":999,"begin":989}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"34645867","span":{"end":994,"begin":989}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"2484f433","span":{"end":1119,"begin":1115}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"60b71e8f","span":{"end":1247,"begin":1219}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"1255b1d1","span":{"end":1226,"begin":1219}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"464649c","span":{"end":1247,"begin":1228}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"7c22d4f","span":{"end":1231,"begin":1228}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"5f59185e","span":{"end":1247,"begin":1237}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"60bdf15d","span":{"end":1242,"begin":1237}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"47da3952","span":{"end":1422,"begin":1415}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"51e4ccb3","span":{"end":1436,"begin":1430}}],"text":"Rickettsia infection in five areas of the state of São Paulo, Brazil.\nThis study investigated rickettsial infection in animals, humans, ticks, and fleas collected in five areas of the state of São Paulo.

Rickettsia felis was the only rickettsia found infecting fleas, whereas Rickettsia bellii was the only agent infecting ticks, but no animal or human blood was shown to contain rickettsial DNA. Testing animal and human sera by indirect immunofluorescence assay against four rickettsia antigens (R. rickettsii, R. parkeri, R. felis, and R. bellii), some opossum, dog, horse, and human sera reacted to R. rickettsii with titers at least four-fold higher than to the other three rickettsial antigens. These sera were considered to have a predominant antibody response to R. rickettsii. Using the same criteria, opossum, dog, and horse sera showed predominant antibody response to R. parkeri or a very closely related genotype. Our serological results suggest that both R. rickettsii and R. parkeri infected animals and\/or humans in the studied areas.\n","relations":[{"pred":"Lives_In","obj":"51e4ccb3","id":"5f77d0f9","subj":"2d10e0b1"},{"pred":"Lives_In","obj":"1c98290c","id":"1b266842","subj":"f9d87b"},{"pred":"Lives_In","obj":"172ca72b","id":"7a3793c7","subj":"f9d87b"},{"pred":"Lives_In","obj":"71e5f61d","id":"651aed93","subj":"f9d87b"},{"pred":"Lives_In","obj":"5bda80bf","id":"4dd6fd0a","subj":"f9d87b"},{"pred":"Lives_In","obj":"89ff02e","id":"bb9e6dc","subj":"6ffab045"},{"pred":"Lives_In","obj":"6865c751","id":"5456afaa","subj":"3e2943ab"},{"pred":"Lives_In","obj":"3624da92","id":"6692b6c6","subj":"2c9399a4"},{"pred":"Lives_In","obj":"33352f32","id":"1cd629b3","subj":"2c9399a4"},{"pred":"Lives_In","obj":"94f6bfb","id":"589da3f3","subj":"2c9399a4"},{"pred":"Lives_In","obj":"464649c","id":"39d76cb5","subj":"53ab0286"},{"pred":"Lives_In","obj":"1e044120","id":"4a00d9cf","subj":"2c9399a4"},{"pred":"Lives_In","obj":"5f59185e","id":"6736fa8d","subj":"53ab0286"},{"pred":"Lives_In","obj":"60b71e8f","id":"52815fa3","subj":"53ab0286"},{"pred":"Lives_In","obj":"47da3952","id":"50313382","subj":"63c5efee"},{"pred":"Lives_In","obj":"51e4ccb3","id":"1cb346ea","subj":"63c5efee"},{"pred":"Lives_In","obj":"47da3952","id":"4c012563","subj":"2d10e0b1"}],"sourcedb":"BioNLP-ST-2016"},{"sourceid":"BB-event-18694716","denotations":[{"obj":"Bacteria","id":"46e8a539","span":{"end":1066,"begin":1035}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"495083a0","span":{"end":268,"begin":222}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"5fd62371","span":{"end":776,"begin":710}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"28a0fd6c","span":{"end":767,"begin":751}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"2b62442c","span":{"end":1339,"begin":1328}}],"text":"Quantitative metabolome analysis using liquid chromatography-high-resolution mass spectrometry.\nIn this report, we introduce a liquid chromatography single-mass spectrometry method for metabolome quantification, using the LTQ Orbitrap high-resolution mass spectrometer.

With the application of this method, quantification was possible within single runs even when the pool sizes of individual metabolites varied from 0.13 to 55.6 microM. As a case study, intracellular concentrations of central metabolites were determined for Methylobacterium extorquens AM1 during growth on two different carbon sources, methanol and succinate. Reproducible results from technical and biological repetitions were obtained that revealed significant variations of intracellular metabolite pool sizes, depending on the carbon source.

It is phagocytosed by immune cells, such as monocytes and macrophages. The precise mechanisms that initiate bacterial uptake have not yet been elucidated. Participation of C3, CR3, class A scavenger receptors and mannose receptor in bacterial uptake have been already reported. However, contribution of an additional, as-yet-unidentified receptor for F. tularensis internalization has been suggested.\nWe show here that cell-surface expressed nucleolin is a receptor for Francisella tularensis Live Vaccine Strain (LVS) and promotes LVS binding and infection of human monocyte-like THP-1 cells. The HB-19 pseudopeptide that binds specifically carboxy-terminal RGG domain of nucleolin inhibits LVS binding and infection of monocyte-like THP-1 cells. In a pull-down assay, elongation factor Tu (EF-Tu), a GTP-binding protein involved in protein translation, usually found in cytoplasm, was recovered among LVS bacterial membrane proteins bound on RGG domain of nucleolin. A specific polyclonal murine antibody was raised against recombinant LVS EF-Tu. By fluorescence and electron microscopy experiments, we found that a fraction of EF-Tu could be detected at the bacterial surface. Anti-EF-Tu antibodies reduced LVS binding to monocyte-like THP-1 cells and impaired infection, even in absence of complement and complement receptors. Interaction between EF-Tu and nucleolin was illustrated by two different pull-down assays using recombinant EF-Tu proteins and either RGG domain of nucleolin or cell solubilized nucleolin.\nAltogether, our results demonstrate that the interaction between surface nucleolin and its bacterial ligand EF-Tu plays an important role in Francisella tularensis adhesion and entry process and may therefore facilitate invasion of host tissues. Since phagosomal escape and intra-cytosolic multiplication of LVS in infected monocytes are very similar to those of human pathogenic F. tularensis ssp tularensis, the mechanism of entry into monocyte-like THP-1 cells, involving interaction between EF-Tu and nucleolin, might be similar in the two subspecies. Thus, the use of either nucleolin-specific pseudopeptide HB-19 or recombinant EF-Tu could provide attractive therapeutic approaches for modulating F. tularensis infection.\n","relations":[{"pred":"Lives_In","obj":"6e521c1e","id":"24c4ddae","subj":"66629f63"},{"pred":"Lives_In","obj":"224b4d61","id":"37fb0bed","subj":"841e575"},{"pred":"Lives_In","obj":"5c48c0c0","id":"a82c5f1","subj":"6b5966e1"},{"pred":"Lives_In","obj":"1d9bec4d","id":"7b7fdc8","subj":"6b5966e1"},{"pred":"Lives_In","obj":"674c583e","id":"51c693d","subj":"65e61854"},{"pred":"Lives_In","obj":"5fb97279","id":"6a57ae10","subj":"3af17be2"},{"pred":"Lives_In","obj":"439a8f59","id":"766653e6","subj":"f9879ac"},{"pred":"Lives_In","obj":"61861a29","id":"4e07b95f","subj":"37f21974"}],"sourcedb":"BioNLP-ST-2016"},{"sourceid":"BB-event-19004249","denotations":[{"obj":"Bacteria","id":"25bcd0c7","span":{"end":242,"begin":221}},{"obj":"Bacteria","id":"32cb636e","span":{"end":263,"begin":247}},{"obj":"Bacteria","id":"63cd604c","span":{"end":317,"begin":308}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"40dd3977","span":{"end":209,"begin":204}}],"text":"Evaluation of antibacterial activity of synthetic aliphatic and aromatic monoacylglycerols.\nThe antibacterial activity of synthetic aliphatic and aromatic monoacylglycerols (MAGs) was studied against two human pathogens: Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli.

The aim of this study was to investigate the characteristics of bile resistance in lactococci by studying the relationship between bile resistance and cellular fatty acid composition in lactococcci grown on different media. We determined the bile resistance of 14 strains in lactose-free M17 medium supplemented with either glucose only (GM17) or lactose only (LM17). Gas chromatographic analyses of free lipids extracted from the tested strains were used for determining their fatty acid composition. A correlation analysis of all strains grown in both media revealed significant positive correlations between bile resistance and relative contents of hexadecanoic acid and octadecenoic acid, and negative correlations between bile resistance and relative contents of hexadecenoic acid and C-19 cyclopropane fatty acid. It is also a fact that the fatty acids associated with bile resistance depended on species, strain, and\/or growth medium. In L. lactis subsp. cremoris strains grown in GM17 medium, the bile-resistant strains had significantly more octadecenoic acid than the bile-sensitive strains. In LM17 medium, bile-resistant strains had significantly more octadecenoic acid and significantly less C-19 cyclopropane fatty acid than the bile-sensitive strains. In L. lactis subsp. lactis strains, bile resistances of some of the tested strains were altered by growth medium. Some strains were resistant to bile in GM17 medium but sensitive to bile in LM17 medium. Some strains were resistant in both media tested. The strains grown in GM17 medium had significantly more hexadecanoic acid and octadecenoic acid, and significantly less tetradecanoic acid, octadecadienoic acid and C-19 cyclopropane fatty acid than the strains grown in LM17 medium. In conclusion, the fatty acid compositions of the bile-resistant lactococci differed from those of the bile-sensitive ones. More importantly, our data suggest that altering their fatty acid composition (i.e. increased hexadecanoic acid and octadecenoic acid and decreased hexadecenoic acid and C-19 cyclopropane fatty acid) by changing growth conditions may be a useful way to enhance their bile resistance in lactococci.\n","relations":[{"pred":"Lives_In","obj":"7f69d591","id":"1e4d3ce5","subj":"4b6579e8"},{"pred":"Lives_In","obj":"2f162cc0","id":"3ddc6915","subj":"4b6579e8"},{"pred":"Lives_In","obj":"669513d8","id":"704deff2","subj":"6fff253c"},{"pred":"Lives_In","obj":"2cab9998","id":"379614be","subj":"6fff253c"}],"sourcedb":"BioNLP-ST-2016"},{"sourceid":"BB-event-19552770","denotations":[{"obj":"Bacteria","id":"314b8f2d","span":{"end":42,"begin":29}},{"obj":"Bacteria","id":"664a9613","span":{"end":137,"begin":119}},{"obj":"Bacteria","id":"5118388b","span":{"end":418,"begin":400}},{"obj":"Bacteria","id":"15a902e7","span":{"end":498,"begin":480}},{"obj":"Bacteria","id":"7876d598","span":{"end":633,"begin":615}},{"obj":"Bacteria","id":"4a3e3e8b","span":{"end":775,"begin":757}},{"obj":"Bacteria","id":"5af28b27","span":{"end":877,"begin":857}},{"obj":"Bacteria","id":"71104a4","span":{"end":910,"begin":892}},{"obj":"Bacteria","id":"4985cbcb","span":{"end":1135,"begin":1117}},{"obj":"Bacteria","id":"72f46e16","span":{"end":1261,"begin":1243}},{"obj":"Bacteria","id":"3c9168dc","span":{"end":1361,"begin":1348}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"332a7fce","span":{"end":56,"begin":46}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"549621f3","span":{"end":71,"begin":58}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"54361a9","span":{"end":171,"begin":141}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"32232e55","span":{"end":186,"begin":173}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"5217f3d0","span":{"end":234,"begin":207}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"37ebc9d8","span":{"end":214,"begin":207}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"293bb8a5","span":{"end":234,"begin":224}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"2416a51","span":{"end":295,"begin":274}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"6fa590ba","span":{"end":295,"begin":283}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"6e9319f","span":{"end":318,"begin":304}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"72e34f77","span":{"end":313,"begin":304}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"7bf9b098","span":{"end":689,"begin":676}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"389adf1d","span":{"end":947,"begin":931}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"77307458","span":{"end":1017,"begin":1005}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"1fc0053e","span":{"end":1073,"begin":1063}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"290b1b2e","span":{"end":1145,"begin":1140}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"47874b25","span":{"end":1176,"begin":1162}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"33617539","span":{"end":1295,"begin":1265}}],"text":"Prevalence of thermotolerant Campylobacter in partridges (Perdix perdix).\nTo estimate the prevalence of thermotolerant Campylobacter spp. in commercially reared partridges (Perdix perdix) in southern Italy.\nCloacal swabs of partridges (n = 240), equally distributed between male and female birds, from a game bird farm located in the Southern Italy were examined for the prevalence of thermotolerant Campylobacter spp. The samples were processed in order to detect thermotolerant Campylobacter spp. by culture methods. The positive samples were then confirmed by multiplex polymerase chain reaction. Thermotolerant Campylobacter spp. were isolated from 118 (49.2%) of the 240 cloacal swabs examined. As proved by PCR, 100% of the strains were identified as Campylobacter coli (118\/118), and 15 (12.7%) out of the 118 positive samples were also positive for Campylobacter jejuni. In contrast, Campylobacter lari was not identified. Adult partridges showed a significantly higher prevalence (P < 0.05) than younger ones.\nThese results reinforce the assumption that game birds may be considered as potential carriers of Campylobacter spp. for human being and other animal species.\nAlthough an earlier 1986 publication described the prevalence of Campylobacter coli in commercially reared partridges, this is the first report to

are resistant to Yersinia YopJ\/P-induced apoptosis and are protected from ROS-mediated cell death by the type III secretion system.\nThe human innate immune system relies on the coordinated activity of macrophages and polymorphonuclear leukocytes (neutrophils or PMNs) for defense against bacterial pathogens. Yersinia spp. subvert the innate immune response to cause disease in humans. In particular, the Yersinia outer protein YopJ (Y. pestis and Y. pseudotuberculosis) and YopP (Y. enterocolitica) rapidly induce apoptosis in murine macrophages and dendritic cells. However, the effects of Yersinia Yop J\/P on neutrophil fate are not clearly defined.\nIn this study, we utilized wild-type and mutant strains of Yersinia to test the contribution of YopJ and YopP on induction of apoptosis in human monocyte-derived macrophages (HMDM) and neutrophils. Whereas YopJ and YopP similarly induced apoptosis in HMDMs, interaction of human neutrophils with virulence plasmid-containing Yersinia did not result in PMN caspase activation, release of LDH, or loss of membrane integrity greater than PMN controls. In contrast, interaction of human PMNs with the virulence plasmid-deficient Y. pestis strain KIM6 resulted in increased surface exposure of phosphatidylserine (PS) and cell death. PMN reactive oxygen species (ROS) production was inhibited in a virulence plasmid-dependent but YopJ\/YopP-independent manner. Following phagocytic interaction with Y. pestis strain KIM6, inhibition of PMN ROS production with diphenyleneiodonium chloride resulted in a reduction of PMN cell death similar to that induced by the virulence plasmid-containing strain Y. pestis KIM5.\nOur findings showed that Yersinia YopJ and\/or YopP did not induce pronounced apoptosis in human neutrophils. Furthermore, robust PMN ROS production in response to virulence plasmid-deficient Yersinia was associated with increased PMN cell death, suggesting that Yersinia inhibition of PMN ROS production plays a role in evasion of the human innate immune response in part by limiting PMN apoptosis.\n","relations":[{"pred":"Lives_In","obj":"11acdc30","id":"275bf9b3","subj":"5db4c359"},{"pred":"Lives_In","obj":"74bdc168","id":"1b8a29df","subj":"4f8969b0"},{"pred":"Lives_In","obj":"7cbee484","id":"4fbe37eb","subj":"1bdf8190"},{"pred":"Lives_In","obj":"319dead1","id":"12a94400","subj":"2fab4aff"}],"sourcedb":"BioNLP-ST-2016"},{"sourceid":"BB-event-20580604","denotations":[{"obj":"Bacteria","id":"a7e2d9d","span":{"end":92,"begin":58}},{"obj":"Bacteria","id":"754777cd","span":{"end":311,"begin":277}},{"obj":"Bacteria","id":"2b52c0d6","span":{"end":316,"begin":313}},{"obj":"Bacteria","id":"372ea2bc","span":{"end":1057,"begin":1054}},{"obj":"Bacteria","id":"4cc76301","span":{"end":1214,"begin":1200}},{"obj":"Bacteria","id":"2f08c4b","span":{"end":1774,"begin":1760}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"3f19b8b3","span":{"end":46,"begin":13}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"7de0c6ae","span":{"end":139,"begin":118}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"a486d78","span":{"end":128,"begin":118}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"cdc3aae","span":{"end":211,"begin":149}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"7ef2d7a6","span":{"end":211,"begin":175}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"5dcbb60","span":{"end":211,"begin":200}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"4c36250e","span":{"end":262,"begin":239}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"21526f6c","span":{"end":354,"begin":348}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"49f5c307","span":{"end":378,"begin":368}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"299266e2","span":{"end":388,"begin":382}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"5471388b","span":{"end":440,"begin":419}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"66ea1466","span":{"end":429,"begin":419}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"1601e47","span":{"end":511,"begin":449}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"3bffddff","span":{"end":511,"begin":475}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"66971f6b","span":{"end":511,"begin":500}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"50687efb","span":{"end":554,"begin":540}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"517bd097","span":{"end":574,"begin":563}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"142eef62","span":{"end":662,"begin":652}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"4a9cc6cb","span":{"end":862,"begin":853}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"5990e6c5","span":{"end":883,"begin":878}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"56e07a08","span":{"end":988,"begin":961}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"35d6ca49","span":{"end":988,"begin":982}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"1950e8a6","span":{"end":1021,"begin":1006}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"47289387","span":{"end":1015,"begin":1006}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"12cd9150","span":{"end":1047,"begin":1034}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"114a85c2","span":{"end":1126,"begin":1121}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"f415a95","span":{"end":1174,"begin":1165}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"cf65451","span":{"end":1228,"begin":1222}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"724f138e","span":{"end":1312,"begin":1302}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"37eeec90","span":{"end":1495,"begin":1467}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"32fe9d0a","span":{"end":1476,"begin":1467}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"c9413d8","span":{"end":1495,"begin":1481}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"64da2a7","span":{"end":1634,"begin":1601}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"46074492","span":{"end":1651,"begin":1642}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"d78795","span":{"end":1722,"begin":1717}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"2c715e84","span":{"end":1813,"begin":1778}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"47428937","span":{"end":1813,"begin":1803}}],"text":"Effects of a probiotic fermented milk beverage containing Lactobacillus casei strain Shirota on defecation frequency, intestinal microbiota, and the intestinal environment of healthy individuals with soft stools.\nThe effects of drinking a fermented milk beverage that contains Lactobacillus casei strain Shirota (LcS) at 40 billion bacterial cells\/bottle for 4 weeks (probiotics, 1 bottle\/day) on defecation frequency, intestinal microbiota and the intestinal environment of healthy individuals with soft stools were evaluated.

Defecation frequency significantly decreased after the 4-week intake period compared with before the probiotic treatment. The stool quality significantly improved (hardened) compared to the placebo. Also, the water content of the stools was lower in the probiotic group than in the placebo group. Live LcS was recovered at 6.9 ± 1.3 and 7.2 ± 0.8 log(10) CFU per 1g of stool after 2 and 4 weeks, respectively, of probiotic treatment. The number of bifidobacteria in the stools also increased significantly compared with the level before starting the probiotics. The organic acid levels (total, acetic acid, propionic acid, and butyric acid) significantly increased compared with the level before intake in both the probiotic and placebo groups, but they returned to the original levels after the end of the intake period.

Health Protection Agency surveillance has shown a decrease in anorectal manifestations despite little demographic change. Two cases of HIV-infected patients presenting with isolated perianal ulcer disease are reported here.

As presentations of LGV diversify, further education and surveillance are needed in order to reduce transmission and prevent long-term complications.

Data from the female mouse model of genital tract chlamydia infection suggests a requirement for TLR2-dependent signaling in the induction of inflammation and oviduct pathology. We hypothesized that the role of TLR2 in moderating mucosal inflammation is site specific. In order to investigate this, we infected mice via the intranasal route with C. muridarum and observed that in the absence of TLR2 activation, mice had more severe disease, higher lung cytokine levels, and an exaggerated influx of neutrophils and T-cells into the lungs. This could not be explained by impaired bacterial clearance as TLR2-deficient mice cleared the infection similar to controls. These data suggest that TLR2 has an anti-inflammatory function in the lung during Chlamydia infection, and that the role of TLR2 in mucosal inflammation varies at different mucosal surfaces.\n","relations":[{"pred":"Lives_In","obj":"302fec27","id":"16b2bb0c","subj":"355e34c7"},{"pred":"Lives_In","obj":"770d0ea6","id":"327af41b","subj":"54709809"},{"pred":"Lives_In","obj":"54107f42","id":"6cb6decd","subj":"2a2da905"},{"pred":"Lives_In","obj":"48c40605","id":"c7045b9","subj":"2a2da905"},{"pred":"Lives_In","obj":"2f2bf0e2","id":"f99f5e0","subj":"24f360b2"},{"pred":"Lives_In","obj":"6cea706c","id":"6aa61224","subj":"24f360b2"},{"pred":"Lives_In","obj":"2f2bf0e2","id":"30bce90b","subj":"24f360b2"},{"pred":"Lives_In","obj":"1a69561c","id":"3e6f3f28","subj":"24f360b2"}],"sourcedb":"BioNLP-ST-2016"},{"sourceid":"BB-event-21894542","denotations":[{"obj":"Bacteria","id":"1b28f282","span":{"end":40,"begin":28}},{"obj":"Bacteria","id":"138fe6ec","span":{"end":54,"begin":42}},{"obj":"Bacteria","id":"5e77f0f4","span":{"end":97,"begin":78}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"19b30c92","span":{"end":204,"begin":190}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"455351c4","span":{"end":268,"begin":249}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"29876704","span":{"end":334,"begin":319}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"4816c290","span":{"end":373,"begin":357}}],"text":"Iron transport in the genus Marinobacter.\nMarinobacter belong to the class of Gammaproteobacteria and these motile, halophilic or halotolerent bacteria are widely distributed throughout the world's oceans having been isolated from a wide variety of marine environments.

To determine whether passive transfer of antibodies (Abs) can provide protection against C. burnetii natural infection, we examined if passive transfer of 1E4 would protect SCID mice against C. burnetii aerosol infection. The results indicated that 1E4 conferred significant protection against aerosolized C. burnetii, suggesting that 1E4 may be useful for preventing C. burnetii natural infection. To further understand the mechanisms of 1E4-mediated protection and to test the possibility of using humanized 1E4 to prevent C. burnetii infection, we examined whether the Fab fragment of 1E4 (Fab1E4), a recombinant murine single-chain variable fragment (muscFv1E4), and a humanized single-chain variable fragment (huscFv1E4) retained the ability of 1E4 to inhibit C. burnetii infection. The results indicated that Fab1E4, muscFv1E4, and huscFv1E4 were able to inhibit C. burnetii infection in mice but that their ability to inhibit C. burnetii infection was lower than that of 1E4. In addition, treatment of C. burnetii with Fab1E4, muscFv1E4, or huscFv1E4 can block C. burnetii infection of macrophages. Interestingly, treatment of C. burnetii with huscFv1E4 can significantly reduce C. burnetii infectivity in human macrophages. This report provides the first evidence to demonstrate that the humanized variable fragments of an LPS-specific MAb can neutralize C. burnetii infection and appears to be a promising step toward the potential use of a humanized MAb as emergency prophylaxis against C. burnetii exposure.\n","relations":[{"pred":"Lives_In","obj":"a50b09c","id":"332729ad","subj":"4e4efc1b"},{"pred":"Lives_In","obj":"6691490c","id":"75d2da2d","subj":"7cc586a8"},{"pred":"Lives_In","obj":"2187fff7","id":"4278284b","subj":"7db534f2"},{"pred":"Lives_In","obj":"21d5c1a0","id":"9573584","subj":"7eb01b12"},{"pred":"Lives_In","obj":"538613b3","id":"3370f42","subj":"6de54b40"},{"pred":"Lives_In","obj":"1eef9aef","id":"6057aebb","subj":"6de54b40"}],"sourcedb":"BioNLP-ST-2016"},{"sourceid":"BB-event-25204345","denotations":[{"obj":"Bacteria","id":"11389053","span":{"end":112,"begin":92}},{"obj":"Bacteria","id":"5db99216","span":{"end":166,"begin":145}},{"obj":"Bacteria","id":"3ec11999","span":{"end":211,"begin":199}},{"obj":"Bacteria","id":"5c1bd44c","span":{"end":229,"begin":216}},{"obj":"Bacteria","id":"9f46d94","span":{"end":685,"begin":665}},{"obj":"Bacteria","id":"18cc679e","span":{"end":1494,"begin":1470}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"2e77b8cf","span":{"end":273,"begin":248}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"2c4ca0f9","span":{"end":285,"begin":278}}],"text":"Association of mutation patterns in GyrA and ParC genes with quinolone resistance levels in lactic acid bacteria.\nThe quinolone resistance of 19 lactic acid bacterial strains belonging to the genera Enterococcus and Lactobacillus isolated from the natural fermented koumiss and yoghurt were investigated.

The unusually low level of resistance of individual cells of H. influenzae containing the TEM-type beta-lactamase may have delayed their emergence or recognition, and has unresolved clinical implications.\n","relations":[{"pred":"Lives_In","obj":"4eeea57d","id":"8e50104","subj":"3574e198"}],"sourcedb":"BioNLP-ST-2016"},{"sourceid":"BB-event-5526468","denotations":[{"obj":"Bacteria","id":"780ec4a5","span":{"end":12,"begin":0}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"e24ddd0","span":{"end":18,"begin":13}}],"text":"Vibrio fetus human infection--isolation from a subacute bacterial endocarditis case.\n","relations":[{"pred":"Lives_In","obj":"e24ddd0","id":"f107c50","subj":"780ec4a5"}],"sourcedb":"BioNLP-ST-2016"},{"sourceid":"BB-event-9521147","denotations":[{"obj":"Bacteria","id":"6f70f32f","span":{"end":66,"begin":36}},{"obj":"Bacteria","id":"548e76f1","span":{"end":155,"begin":151}},{"obj":"Bacteria","id":"5aabbb29","span":{"end":297,"begin":258}},{"obj":"Bacteria","id":"72c927f1","span":{"end":297,"begin":272}},{"obj":"Bacteria","id":"1ac85b0c","span":{"end":711,"begin":696}},{"obj":"Bacteria","id":"3dd69f5a","span":{"end":1184,"begin":1180}},{"obj":"Bacteria","id":"3aa3193a","span":{"end":1202,"begin":1198}},{"obj":"Bacteria","id":"1ee4730","span":{"end":1216,"begin":1212}},{"obj":"Bacteria","id":"59a67c3a","span":{"end":1493,"begin":1489}},{"obj":"Bacteria","id":"5003041b","span":{"end":1502,"begin":1498}},{"obj":"Bacteria","id":"724bade8","span":{"end":1580,"begin":1565}},{"obj":"Bacteria","id":"16fb356","span":{"end":1741,"begin":1726}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"6bc248ed","span":{"end":164,"begin":156}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"23a9ba52","span":{"end":442,"begin":434}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"ca27722","span":{"end":832,"begin":756}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"70ab80e3","span":{"end":832,"begin":766}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"9573b3b","span":{"end":1193,"begin":1185}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"67427b69","span":{"end":1207,"begin":1203}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"78461bc4","span":{"end":1221,"begin":1217}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"544630b7","span":{"end":1374,"begin":1339}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"64f857e7","span":{"end":1374,"begin":1349}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"1095f122","span":{"end":1401,"begin":1379}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"58c540cf","span":{"end":1396,"begin":1379}}],"text":"Lipopolysaccharide from nonvirulent Ara+ Burkholderia pseudomallei isolates is immunologically indistinguishable from lipopolysaccharide from virulent Ara- clinical isolates.\nDifferent lines of evidence suggest that a discrepancy between the distribution of Burkholderia (Pseudomonas) pseudomallei in the environment and the distribution of the disease melioidosis is attributable, at least in part, to phenotypic differences between clinical and some environmental isolates. Two antigenically and biochemically distinct biotypes have been described, only one of which is virulent. In this study, lipopolysaccharides (LPSs) were extracted by the proteinase K digestion method from a total of 214 B. pseudomallei isolates, and their immunoreactivities with sera from patients with different clinical spectra and with other infections were evaluated. With the exception of4 isolates from a total of 214 tested, the sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis silver-staining profiles of the LPSs from the two biotypes showed identical ladder patterns that were typical for smooth LPSs from other gram-negative bacteria. The 210 isolates with typical LPS patterns (119 Ara- clinical, 13 Ara- soil, 70 Ara+ soil, and 8 reference National Type Culture Collection strains) also exhibited similar immunoblot profiles against pooled sera from patients with melioidosis and hyperimmune mouse sera. Concordant findings were noted in the indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay with Ara- and Ara+ LPSs to coat the microtiter plates. The LPSs of the different B. pseudomallei biotypes appear antigenically indistinguishable. It is, therefore, unlikely that this component is related to the virulence and pathogenicity of B. pseudomallei.\n","relations":[{"pred":"Lives_In","obj":"58c540cf","id":"ae3540e","subj":"1ac85b0c"},{"pred":"Lives_In","obj":"64f857e7","id":"600b9d27","subj":"1ac85b0c"},{"pred":"Lives_In","obj":"9573b3b","id":"3688eb5b","subj":"3dd69f5a"},{"pred":"Lives_In","obj":"67427b69","id":"69f1a286","subj":"3aa3193a"},{"pred":"Lives_In","obj":"78461bc4","id":"7922d892","subj":"1ee4730"}],"sourcedb":"BioNLP-ST-2016"},{"sourceid":"BB-event-9553794","denotations":[{"obj":"Bacteria","id":"3d6300e8","span":{"end":50,"begin":26}},{"obj":"Bacteria","id":"1b822fcc","span":{"end":243,"begin":223}},{"obj":"Bacteria","id":"24a1c17f","span":{"end":248,"begin":245}},{"obj":"Bacteria","id":"56102e1c","span":{"end":600,"begin":597}},{"obj":"Bacteria","id":"73511076","span":{"end":818,"begin":815}},{"obj":"Bacteria","id":"7927bd9f","span":{"end":1097,"begin":1087}},{"obj":"Bacteria","id":"532721fd","span":{"end":1120,"begin":1110}},{"obj":"Bacteria","id":"410954b","span":{"end":1140,"begin":1122}},{"obj":"Bacteria","id":"7fb9f71f","span":{"end":1166,"begin":1142}},{"obj":"Bacteria","id":"3b366632","span":{"end":1189,"begin":1168}},{"obj":"Bacteria","id":"51f49060","span":{"end":1212,"begin":1194}},{"obj":"Bacteria","id":"514eedd8","span":{"end":1251,"begin":1231}},{"obj":"Bacteria","id":"617fe9e1","span":{"end":1321,"begin":1318}},{"obj":"Bacteria","id":"6970140a","span":{"end":1374,"begin":1350}},{"obj":"Bacteria","id":"1cf2fed4","span":{"end":1425,"begin":1422}},{"obj":"Bacteria","id":"3af4e0bf","span":{"end":1527,"begin":1513}},{"obj":"Bacteria","id":"245a26e1","span":{"end":1590,"begin":1578}},{"obj":"Bacteria","id":"4d63b624","span":{"end":1860,"begin":1848}},{"obj":"Bacteria","id":"466cf502","span":{"end":2110,"begin":2107}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"5b800468","span":{"end":145,"begin":66}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"2e185cd7","span":{"end":161,"begin":151}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"7e1a1da6","span":{"end":191,"begin":165}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"5f7f2382","span":{"end":498,"begin":466}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"407cf41","span":{"end":580,"begin":570}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"6815c5f2","span":{"end":658,"begin":597}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"46cc127b","span":{"end":1018,"begin":1003}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"60094a13","span":{"end":1067,"begin":1047}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"5aceec94","span":{"end":1332,"begin":1318}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"1c32886a","span":{"end":1701,"begin":1661}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"3a4b0e5d","span":{"end":1713,"begin":1707}}],"text":"Evaluation of the role of Carnobacterium piscicola in spoilage of vacuum- and modified-atmosphere-packed cold-smoked salmon stored at 5 degrees C.\nThe microflora on spoiled cold-smoked salmon often consists of a mixture of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) and Gram-negative bacteria. To elucidate the role of the different groups, a storage trial was carried out in which nisin and CO2 were used for the selective inhibition of the two bacterial groups. The shelf-life of vacuum-packed cold-smoked salmon, recorded by sensory evaluation, was four weeks at 5 degrees C and the microflora was composed of LAB (10(6)-10(7) cfu\/g) with an associate Gram-negative flora in varying levels (10(5)-10(7) cfu\/g). The addition of nisin and\/or a CO2-atmosphere increased the shelf-life to five or six weeks and limited the level of LAB to about 10(4)-10(6), 10(3)-10(6) and 10(2)-10(4) cfu\/g, respectively. CO2-atmosphere +\/- nisin inhibited the growth of Gram-negative bacteria, whereas nisin had no effect on these in vacuum packages. The Gram-negative flora on vacuum-packed salmon was dominated by a Vibrio sp., resembling V. marinus, Enterobacteriaceae (Enterobacter agglomerans, Serratia liquefaciens and Rahnella aquatilis) and occasionally Aeromonas hydrophila. Irrespective of the addition of nisin and\/or CO2-atmosphere, the LAB microflora was dominated by Carnobacterium piscicola, which was found to account for 87% of the 255 LAB isolates characterized. Whole-cell-protein patterns analysed by SDS-PAGE confirmed the Carnobacterium species identification. The spoilage potential of C. piscicola isolates was further studied by inoculation of approx. 10(6) cfu\/g in cold-smoked salmon stored at 5 degrees C. The salmon did not spoil within 4 weeks of storage in vacuum- or CO2-atmosphere, and it is concluded that despite high levels (> 10(7) cfu\/g) of C. piscicola, sensory rejection was caused by autolytic changes. This was supported by the development of soft texture and sour, rancid and bitter off-flavours at the point of spoilage, irrespective of the length of shelf-life and low or high total counts of LAB and Gram-negative bacteria.\n","relations":[{"pred":"Lives_In","obj":"7e1a1da6","id":"35645047","subj":"1b822fcc"},{"pred":"Lives_In","obj":"2e185cd7","id":"6f44a157","subj":"1b822fcc"},{"pred":"Lives_In","obj":"5f7f2382","id":"6bc407fd","subj":"56102e1c"},{"pred":"Lives_In","obj":"407cf41","id":"291f18","subj":"56102e1c"},{"pred":"Lives_In","obj":"60094a13","id":"17d88132","subj":"7927bd9f"},{"pred":"Lives_In","obj":"60094a13","id":"5ddcc487","subj":"410954b"},{"pred":"Lives_In","obj":"60094a13","id":"16eccb2e","subj":"7fb9f71f"},{"pred":"Lives_In","obj":"60094a13","id":"5ef5c734","subj":"3b366632"},{"pred":"Lives_In","obj":"60094a13","id":"d771cc9","subj":"51f49060"},{"pred":"Lives_In","obj":"60094a13","id":"36b4091c","subj":"514eedd8"},{"pred":"Lives_In","obj":"5aceec94","id":"4671115f","subj":"6970140a"},{"pred":"Lives_In","obj":"5aceec94","id":"36cda2c2","subj":"617fe9e1"},{"pred":"Lives_In","obj":"3a4b0e5d","id":"3697186","subj":"4d63b624"},{"pred":"Lives_In","obj":"1c32886a","id":"1583741e","subj":"245a26e1"}],"sourcedb":"BioNLP-ST-2016"},{"sourceid":"BB-event-9745160","denotations":[{"obj":"Bacteria","id":"10b892d5","span":{"end":98,"begin":79}},{"obj":"Bacteria","id":"3d3f761a","span":{"end":215,"begin":196}},{"obj":"Bacteria","id":"3546d80f","span":{"end":720,"begin":712}},{"obj":"Bacteria","id":"579d011c","span":{"end":796,"begin":783}},{"obj":"Bacteria","id":"3670f00","span":{"end":1279,"begin":1271}},{"obj":"Bacteria","id":"452e26d0","span":{"end":1427,"begin":1419}},{"obj":"Bacteria","id":"46ab18da","span":{"end":1635,"begin":1627}},{"obj":"Bacteria","id":"790174f2","span":{"end":1659,"begin":1651}},{"obj":"Bacteria","id":"42257bdd","span":{"end":2366,"begin":2358}},{"obj":"Bacteria","id":"7689ddef","span":{"end":2547,"begin":2539}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"687a762c","span":{"end":73,"begin":59}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"1a2e2935","span":{"end":67,"begin":59}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"733c423e","span":{"end":179,"begin":165}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"4b629f13","span":{"end":173,"begin":165}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"70925b45","span":{"end":553,"begin":546}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"1b9ea3e3","span":{"end":730,"begin":664}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"aa22f1c","span":{"end":699,"begin":685}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"55e7a35c","span":{"end":693,"begin":685}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"37cd92d6","span":{"end":1441,"begin":1436}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"5922ae77","span":{"end":1496,"begin":1488}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"4263b080","span":{"end":1568,"begin":1560}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"2af616d3","span":{"end":1781,"begin":1776}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"71f67a79","span":{"end":1891,"begin":1883}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"3deb2326","span":{"end":2023,"begin":1985}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"62d363ab","span":{"end":2107,"begin":2065}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"7889a1ac","span":{"end":2240,"begin":2232}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"3aee3976","span":{"end":2522,"begin":2508}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"5ef8df1e","span":{"end":2516,"begin":2508}}],"text":"New one-week, low-dose triple therapy for the treatment of duodenal ulcer with Helicobacter pylori infection.\nAntimicrobial therapy is the recommended treatment for duodenal ulcer associated with Helicobacter pylori infection. The eradication of bismuth-based triple therapy with bismuth subcitrate, metronidazole and amoxicillin is limited by low compliance, drug resistance and side-effects. Two-week proton pump inhibitor (PPI)-based triple therapy has a higher eradication rate but is costly. This study was designed to compare the efficacy, patient compliance and cost of short-term PPI-based triple therapy with those of bismuth-based triple therapy.\nNinety patients with active duodenal ulcer disease and H pylori infection, proven with the 13C-urea breath test and CLO test (Campylobacter-like organism test) were treated randomly in three therapeutic groups: Group A, DeNol 120 mg, amoxicillin 500 mg and metronidazole 250 mg four times a day orally for 14 days; Group B, omeprazole 20 mg plus clarithromycin 500 mg twice a day and amoxicillin 500 mg four times a day for 14 days; Group C, omeprazole 20 mg, clarithromycin 250 mg and metronidazole 500 mg twice a day for seven days. Nizatidine 150 mg twice a day was given continuously following the end of anti-H pylori therapy for each group. Two months later, endoscopy, the CLO test and 13C-urea breath test were repeated to assess the eradication rate of H pylori and the ulcer-healing rate. Drug tolerance was evaluated by patients themselves by daily recording of any side-effects.\nEighty-four patients completed the entire course of therapy and evaluation for H pylori infection. The H pylori eradication rates in Groups A, B and C were 75% (21\/28), 93% (26\/28) and 89% (25\/28), respectively (p = 0.466). The ulcer healing rate was 86% (24\/28) in Group A and 89% (25\/28) in Groups B and C (p = 0.764). A total of 74 patients (88%) were free from symptoms at the end of the triple therapy. Symptom relief was faster in patients with PPI-based triple therapy (Groups B and C) (days 3 and 4) than for patients with bismuth-based triple therapy (day 5). The cost of Group C therapy was lower than that for Groups A and B. There were no major side-effects in any of the patients.\nOne-week triple therapy with omeprazole, clarithromycin and metronidazole is highly effected for the eradication of H pylori. A therapeutic regime of one week's duration with lower cost, good compliance and mild side-effects may offer a good choice for treatment of duodenal ulcer associated with H pylori infection in clinical practice.\n","relations":[{"pred":"Lives_In","obj":"687a762c","id":"3bd323e9","subj":"10b892d5"},{"pred":"Lives_In","obj":"1a2e2935","id":"39ac0c0a","subj":"10b892d5"},{"pred":"Lives_In","obj":"733c423e","id":"c7ba306","subj":"3d3f761a"},{"pred":"Lives_In","obj":"4b629f13","id":"4ff8d125","subj":"3d3f761a"},{"pred":"Lives_In","obj":"1b9ea3e3","id":"6d167f58","subj":"3546d80f"},{"pred":"Lives_In","obj":"aa22f1c","id":"3403e2ac","subj":"3546d80f"},{"pred":"Lives_In","obj":"55e7a35c","id":"65b104b9","subj":"3546d80f"},{"pred":"Lives_In","obj":"5ef8df1e","id":"6c4980d3","subj":"7689ddef"},{"pred":"Lives_In","obj":"3aee3976","id":"327bcebd","subj":"7689ddef"}],"sourcedb":"BioNLP-ST-2016"},{"sourceid":"BB-event-10639454","denotations":[{"obj":"Bacteria","id":"27cf3151","span":{"end":76,"begin":60}},{"obj":"Bacteria","id":"127e70c5","span":{"end":182,"begin":166}},{"obj":"Bacteria","id":"5910de75","span":{"end":496,"begin":492}},{"obj":"Bacteria","id":"4108fa66","span":{"end":544,"begin":531}},{"obj":"Bacteria","id":"1f130eaf","span":{"end":814,"begin":810}},{"obj":"Bacteria","id":"7e0aadd0","span":{"end":832,"begin":819}},{"obj":"Bacteria","id":"21362712","span":{"end":1110,"begin":1106}},{"obj":"Bacteria","id":"27eb3298","span":{"end":1158,"begin":1145}},{"obj":"Bacteria","id":"200a26bc","span":{"end":1426,"begin":1414}},{"obj":"Bacteria","id":"bc57b40","span":{"end":1682,"begin":1670}},{"obj":"Bacteria","id":"1b5bc39d","span":{"end":1887,"begin":1867}},{"obj":"Bacteria","id":"655a5d9c","span":{"end":1904,"begin":1891}},{"obj":"Bacteria","id":"1494b84d","span":{"end":2127,"begin":2123}},{"obj":"Bacteria","id":"34abdee4","span":{"end":2144,"begin":2131}},{"obj":"Bacteria","id":"71a9b4c7","span":{"end":2216,"begin":2212}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"4628b1d3","span":{"end":159,"begin":134}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"77cf3f8b","span":{"end":215,"begin":205}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"1df98368","span":{"end":234,"begin":219}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"21ca139c","span":{"end":253,"begin":249}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"226f885f","span":{"end":368,"begin":361}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"2cd2c8fe","span":{"end":428,"begin":385}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"7d61eccf","span":{"end":402,"begin":393}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"cc6460c","span":{"end":647,"begin":610}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"52350abb","span":{"end":614,"begin":610}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"681aad3b","span":{"end":647,"begin":619}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"1a6f2363","span":{"end":626,"begin":619}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"2427e004","span":{"end":710,"begin":703}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"5ebd56e9","span":{"end":768,"begin":740}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"63f34b70","span":{"end":768,"begin":750}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"641856","span":{"end":791,"begin":781}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"1b58ff9e","span":{"end":854,"begin":849}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"2f66e802","span":{"end":864,"begin":859}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"56b78e55","span":{"end":888,"begin":866}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"76318a7d","span":{"end":881,"begin":866}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"2a492f2a","span":{"end":895,"begin":890}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"3277e499","span":{"end":902,"begin":897}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"585811a4","span":{"end":910,"begin":904}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"22c01ab0","span":{"end":922,"begin":916}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"411341bd","span":{"end":1023,"begin":985}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"4c4d362a","span":{"end":995,"begin":985}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"5400db36","span":{"end":1023,"begin":1000}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"76b74e9c","span":{"end":1015,"begin":1000}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"2d72f75e","span":{"end":1064,"begin":1027}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"8ab78bc","span":{"end":1098,"begin":1093}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"5aa0dbf4","span":{"end":1279,"begin":1160}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"16afbd92","span":{"end":1170,"begin":1160}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"2c5d601e","span":{"end":1177,"begin":1172}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"7fe083b1","span":{"end":1187,"begin":1182}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"23c388c2","span":{"end":1279,"begin":1190}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"486be205","span":{"end":1205,"begin":1190}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"f713686","span":{"end":1211,"begin":1207}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"74f7d1d2","span":{"end":1222,"begin":1216}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"4b4dd216","span":{"end":1279,"begin":1229}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"5ca17ab0","span":{"end":1235,"begin":1229}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"5a62b2a4","span":{"end":1259,"begin":1237}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"1051817b","span":{"end":1270,"begin":1264}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"35293c05","span":{"end":1584,"begin":1567}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"620aa4ea","span":{"end":1577,"begin":1567}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"2db2dd9d","span":{"end":1617,"begin":1597}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"3174cb09","span":{"end":1682,"begin":1621}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"4d411036","span":{"end":1669,"begin":1659}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"7adbd080","span":{"end":1735,"begin":1719}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"41beb473","span":{"end":1839,"begin":1802}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"560513ce","span":{"end":1839,"begin":1817}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"130

of a role of cytotoxic necrotizing factor 1 toxin from Escherichia coli in bacterial pathogenicity and host cytokine response in infected germfree piglets.\nSome Escherichia coli strains isolated from intestinal or extraintestinal infections in pigs produce cytotoxic necrotizing factor 1 (CNF1). In order to analyze the role of CNF1 in the pathogenesis of porcine colibacillosis, newborn colostrum-deprived germfree piglets were orally inoculated with a wild-type CNF1-producing strain (M623) or with an isogenic cnf1 mutant (M623DeltaCNF1). The two isogenic strains induced a high mortality with similar lung and serosal inflammatory lesions, indicating that both strains were pathogenic in these piglets. Bacterial counts in various organs of inoculated piglets revealed an intestinal predisposition of M623 and M623DeltaCNF1 strains for the cecum and colon. Extraintestinal organs (lungs, liver, spleen, and kidney) were also colonized by both strains. Similar colonization of intestinal and extraintestinal tissues in animals inoculated with either strain was observed, except in the ileum, where M623 showed a higher colonization than M623DeltaCNF1. Intestinal (ileum and colon), extraintestinal (lung and kidney), and immune (mesenteric lymph nodes and spleen) tissues were sampled at 1 day postinoculation and analyzed for cytokine expression by a reverse transcriptase PCR technique. Inoculation with E. coli M623 induced an enhanced expression of inflammatory cytokines (interleukin-1alpha [IL-1alpha], tumor necrosis factor alpha, and IL-12p40) in the intestinal organs compared to uninoculated piglets or piglets inoculated with nonpathogenic intestinal E. coli 862B, which is also able to colonize the intestinal tract. There was little difference in cytokine transcript levels in the intestinal and extraintestinal organs in piglets inoculated with E. coli strains M623 or M623DeltaCNF1, except in the ileum, where IL-1alpha and IL-8 mRNA levels correlated with bacterial colonization. Expression of regulatory cytokines (gamma interferon and IL-4) was weak in immune tissues from piglets inoculated with M623 or M623DeltaCNF1. Taken together, our data indicate that the CNF1-producing strain, M623, is pathogenic and induces inflammatory cytokine expression in germfree, colostrum-deprived piglets. Nevertheless, in this model, the CNF1 toxin does not appear to be a major factor for pathogenicity or cytokine response, as demonstrated by the use of an isogenic cnf1 mutant.\n","relations":[],"sourcedb":"BioNLP-ST-2016"},{"sourceid":"BB-event-10941782","denotations":[{"obj":"Bacteria","id":"c00fff0","span":{"end":654,"begin":625}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"263f04ca","span":{"end":19,"begin":0}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"2ca47471","span":{"end":43,"begin":23}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"5a021cb9","span":{"end":29,"begin":23}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"51768776","span":{"end":108,"begin":88}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"f31c0c6","span":{"end":94,"begin":88}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"b93aad","span":{"end":336,"begin":317}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"4a9419d7","span":{"end":323,"begin":317}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"2f3c6ac4","span":{"end":597,"begin":556}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"2e8ab815","span":{"end":762,"begin":744}}],"text":"Microbial symbionts of marine invertebrates: opportunities for microbial biotechnology.\nMarine invertebrates are sources of a diverse array of bioactive metabolites with great potential for development as drugs and research tools.

This review highlights the recent advances in molecular techniques for identification of nontuberculous mycobacteria.\nNontuberculous mycobacteria are ubiquitous towards the environment and have the potential to colonize and cause serious infection. An increasing number of species and clinical presentations are being described, and progress has been made towards the understanding of the underlying predisposing factors. Disease caused by nontuberculous mycobacteria is often associated with various forms of immunosuppression, particularly HIV infection, whereas mild forms of immune defects have been observed in some patients who, apart from their nontuberculous mycobacterial disease, seem to be healthy on initial examination. Molecular techniques have shown their usefulness for the identification of most mycobacteria. Probes are widely used in clinical laboratories for the identification of the most common mycobacterial species. Because automated DNA sequencing and the programs for analysing sequence data have become technically simpler, polymerase chain reaction-based sequencing is now used in many mycobacterial reference laboratories as a routine method for species identification.\nSignificant advances have been made with molecular tools for diagnosis of mycobacteria.

A specific polyclonal rabbit antiserum against W. recta strain 372 was used for indirect immunofluorescence localization of W. recta in dental plaque from untreated and treated patients. Supragingival plaque was collected from 15 periodontally healthy individuals (H), 10 adults with mild gingivitis (G1), 8 with severe gingivitis (G2) and 15 with periodontitis (AP). Subgingival samples from 23 diseased sites (G2 and AP) were examined as well. There was a significant difference (p = 0.000) between the proportions of W. recta in subgingival (4.4%) vs. supragingival (0.3%) plaque samples from AP. A significant difference (p = 0.000) in W. recta proportions was also detected between subgingival plaque samples of AP (4.4%) vs. G2 (1.2%). No significant difference in the mean % of W. recta was found between supragingival plaque of AP (0.3%) and G2 (0%), and samples of G1 (0.01%) and H (0.1%). In a separate study, 85 adults previously treated for moderate to severe adult periodontitis were monitored over a 12-month period for evidence of disease recurrence. Recurrent disease was detected at 32 sites in 18 subjects. Of these, 20 sites in 13 subjects were positive for W. recta.

This study increases the spatial data available for 13 potential plague vectors by using the ecological niche modeling system Genetic Algorithm for Rule-Set Production (GARP) to predict their respective distributions. Because the available sample sizes in our data set varied greatly from one species to another, we also performed an analysis of the robustness of GARP by using the data available for flea Oropsylla montana (Baker) to quantify the effects that sample size and the chosen explanatory variables have on the final species distribution map. GARP effectively modeled the distributions of 13 vector species. Furthermore, our analyses show that all of these modeled ranges are robust, with a sample size of six fleas or greater not significantly impacting the percentage of the in-state area where the flea was predicted to be found, or the testing accuracy of the model.

Unlike the O-chain, the core oligosaccharide and lipid A moieties of iron-replete and iron-limited bacteria and their OMVs were similar. Quantitatively, shed OMVs from iron-replete bacteria were found to be LPSenriched, whereas shed OMVs from iron-limited bacteria had a significantly reduced content of LPS.

In Escherichia coli, the EnvZ\/OmpR two-component system is best understood as regulating expression of outer membrane proteins, but in Salmonella enterica, OmpR activates transcription of the SsrA\/B two-component system located on Salmonella pathogenicity island 2 (SPI-2). The response regulator SsrB controls expression of a type III secretory system in which effectors modify the vacuolar membrane and prevent its degradation via the endocytic pathway. Vacuolar modification enables Salmonella to survive and replicate in the macrophage phagosome and disseminate to the liver and spleen to cause systemic infection. The signals that activate EnvZ and SsrA are unknown but are related to the acidic pH encountered in the vacuole. Our previous work established that SsrB binds to regions of DNA that are AT-rich, with poor sequence conservation. Although SsrB is a major virulence regulator in Salmonella, very little is known regarding how it binds DNA and activates transcription. In the present work, we solved the structure of the C-terminal DNA binding domain of SsrB (SsrB(C)) by NMR and analyzed the effect of amino acid substitutions on function. We identified residues in the DNA recognition helix (Lys(179), Met(186)) and the dimerization interface (Val(197), Leu(201)) that are important for SsrB transcriptional activation and DNA binding. An essential cysteine residue in the N-terminal receiver domain was also identified (Cys(45)), and the effect of Cys(203) on dimerization was evaluated. Our results suggest that although disulfide bond formation is not required for dimerization, dimerization occurs upon DNA binding and is required for subsequent activation of transcription. Disruption of the dimer interface by a C203E substitution reduces SsrB activity. Modification of Cys(203) or Cys(45) may be an important mode of SsrB inactivation inside the host.\n","relations":[],"sourcedb":"BioNLP-ST-2016"},{"sourceid":"BB-event-19329624","denotations":[{"obj":"Bacteria","id":"751e664e","span":{"end":22,"begin":0}},{"obj":"Bacteria","id":"160c3ec1","span":{"end":165,"begin":157}},{"obj":"Bacteria","id":"182b435b","span":{"end":723,"begin":715}},{"obj":"Bacteria","id":"4d0402b","span":{"end":769,"begin":747}},{"obj":"Bacteria","id":"2fa7ae9","span":{"end":835,"begin":809}},{"obj":"Bacteria","id":"7577b641","span":{"end":899,"begin":891}},{"obj":"Bacteria","id":"3704122f","span":{"end":1044,"begin":999}},{"obj":"Bacteria","id":"3153ddfc","span":{"end":1100,"begin":1055}},{"obj":"Bacteria","id":"60afd40d","span":{"end":1142,"begin":1115}},{"obj":"Bacteria","id":"28a2a3e7","span":{"end":1268,"begin":1260}},{"obj":"Bacteria","id":"3f2049b6","span":{"end":1334,"begin":1322}},{"obj":"Bacteria","id":"10b3df93","span":{"end":1376,"begin":1354}},{"obj":"Bacteria","id":"ea27e34","span":{"end":1426,"begin":1418}},{"obj":"Bacteria","id":"33a2499c","span":{"end":1441,"begin":1429}},{"obj":"Bacteria","id":"e72dba7","span":{"end":1452,"begin":1442}},{"obj":"Bacteria","id":"33c2bd","span":{"end":1466,"begin":1453}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"1dfd5f51","span":{"end":52,"begin":38}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"3c321bdb","span":{"end":60,"begin":54}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"24855019","span":{"end":199,"begin":185}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"3abd581e","span":{"end":207,"begin":201}}],"text":"Salinivibrio siamensis sp. nov., from fermented fish (pla-ra) in Thailand.\nA Gram-negative, facultatively anaerobic, moderately halophilic bacterium, strain ND1-1(T), was isolated from fermented fish (pla-ra) in Thailand.

This review collates the known immune responses of the liver to Gram-negative bacterial toxins, with a focus on LSECs. Hyperlipidemia is an important response to Gram-negative bacterial sepsis. The mechanisms proposed for sepsis-associated hyperlipidemia include tissue lipoprotein lipase inhibition and upregulated hepatic triglyceride production. In this review, we propose defenestration of the LSECs by bacterial toxins as an additional mechanism for the hyperlipidemia of sepsis.

Documenting the presence of H pylori in a gastric biopsy is essential for appropriate patient care. Several special stains and immunohistochemistry (IHC) stain for H pylori are available, and many laboratories are routinely using one of them. We introduced routine IHC for H pylori about a year ago, and this study aims to investigate the value of this protocol. A total of 224 patients qualified for the study criteria during this period. The diagnoses were chronic active gastritis (68), chronic gastritis (76), no pathologic abnormality (50), reactive gastropathy (24), and polyps (6). Fifty-four cases were positive for H pylori on IHC, including 50 chronic active gastritis and 4 chronic gastritis. The IHC positive rate was 73.5% (50\/68) in chronic active gastritis, 5.3% (4\/76) in chronic gastritis, and 0% (0\/80) in other diagnoses. The sensitivity\/specificity of finding H pylori by blindly reviewing hematoxylin and eosin slides was 100%\/100%, 100%\/100%, 95%\/100%, and 100%\/100% from the 4 authors. Our results showed that many gastric biopsies (35.7%, 80\/224) had no pathologic abnormality or reactive gastropathy and did not need a routine IHC for H pylori. Hematoxylin and eosin slide review had a very good sensitivity and specificity with all levels of observers. In summary, IHC for H pylori should not be routinely used, especially during these economically challenging times. Immunohistochemistry should be reserved for unexplained gastritis and previously treated patients with likely low organism density.\n","relations":[],"sourcedb":"BioNLP-ST-2016"},{"sourceid":"BB-event-20950772","denotations":[{"obj":"Bacteria","id":"51abf713","span":{"end":67,"begin":46}},{"obj":"Bacteria","id":"eadb475","span":{"end":98,"begin":77}},{"obj":"Bacteria","id":"4d4d48a6","span":{"end":308,"begin":296}},{"obj":"Bacteria","id":"315df4bb","span":{"end":903,"begin":891}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"3fc08eec","span":{"end":151,"begin":141}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"5cad8b7d","span":{"end":260,"begin":252}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"7b02e036","span":{"end":507,"begin":476}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"25243bc1","span":{"end":607,"begin":599}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"1e287667","span":{"end":687,"begin":679}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"2e6ee0bc","span":{"end":956,"begin":948}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"4201a617","span":{"end":1006,"begin":998}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"467f77a5","span":{"end":1078,"begin":1070}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"1bb9aa43","span":{"end":1120,"begin":1112}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"420bc288","span":{"end":1290,"begin":1282}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"df5f5c0","span":{"end":1477,"begin":1469}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"308a6984","span":{"end":1618,"begin":1610}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"66b72664","span":{"end":1689,"begin":1684}}],"text":"Outcomes of emergency colectomy for fulminant Clostridium difficile colitis.\nClostridium difficile has become increasingly a common cause of nosocomial infection with increasing antibiotic usage.

Adhesion to host cells is a crucial step during infection. In Corynebacterium diphtheriae, adhesion is mediated primarily by filamentous structures called pili or fimbriae that are covalently attached to the bacterial cell wall. C. diphtheriae produces three distinct pilus structures, SpaA-, SpaD- and SpaH-type pili. Similar to other types, the prototype SpaA pilus consists of SpaA forming the pilus shaft and two minor pilins SpaB and SpaC located at the base and at the tip, respectively. The minor pilins SpaB\/SpaC are critical for bacterial binding to human pharyngeal cells, and thus represent the major adhesins of corynebacteria. Like pili of many other gram-positive microbes, the assembly of corynebacterial pili occurs by a two-step mechanism, whereby pilins are covalently polymerized by a transpeptidase enzyme named pilin-specific sortase and the generated pilus polymer is subsequently anchored to the cell wall peptidoglycan via the base pilin by the housekeeping sortase or a non-polymerizing sortase.

During the late epidemic period, a strain that failed to ferment sucrose dominated cholera outbreaks in the Northern Brazilian Amazon region. In order to understand the genomic characteristics and the determinants of this altered sucrose fermenting phenotype, the genome of the strain IEC224 was sequenced. This paper reports a broad genomic study of this strain, showing its correlation with the major epidemic lineage. The potentially mobile genomic regions are shown to possess GC content deviation, and harbor the main V. cholera virulence genes. A novel bioinformatic approach was applied in order to identify the putative functions of hypothetical proteins, and was compared with the automatic annotation by RAST. The genome of a large bacteriophage was found to be integrated to the IEC224's alanine aminopeptidase gene. The presence of this phage is shown to be a common characteristic of the El Tor strains from the Latin American epidemic, as well as its putative ancestor from Angola. The defective sucrose fermenting phenotype is shown to be due to a single nucleotide insertion in the V. cholerae sucrose-specific transportation gene. This frame-shift mutation truncated a membrane protein, altering its structural pore-like conformation. Further, the identification of a common bacteriophage reinforces both the monophyletic and African-Origin hypotheses for the main causative agent of the 1991 Latin America cholera epidemics.\n","relations":[],"sourcedb":"BioNLP-ST-2016"},{"sourceid":"BB-event-23339910","denotations":[{"obj":"Bacteria","id":"36b6964d","span":{"end":115,"begin":96}},{"obj":"Bacteria","id":"31198ceb","span":{"end":289,"begin":270}},{"obj":"Bacteria","id":"9257031","span":{"end":304,"begin":291}},{"obj":"Bacteria","id":"75201592","span":{"end":921,"begin":908}},{"obj":"Bacteria","id":"7726e185","span":{"end":1271,"begin":1258}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"aa5455e","span":{"end":8,"begin":0}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"282308c3","span":{"end":66,"begin":46}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"5dda14d0","span":{"end":90,"begin":77}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"1db0ec27","span":{"end":150,"begin":124}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"3d9fc57a","span":{"end":171,"begin":162}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"d4ab71a","span":{"end":265,"begin":226}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"3b4ef7","span":{"end":257,"begin":226}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"1af05b03","span":{"end":241,"begin":226}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"5987e932","span":{"end":251,"begin":243}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"1ad777f","span":{"end":333,"begin":318}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"5bbbdd4b","span":{"end":354,"begin":335}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"438bad7c","span":{"end":369,"begin":356}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"25230246","span":{"end":443,"begin":430}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"4fdf8f12","span":{"end":516,"begin":506}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"4a8b5227","span":{"end":602,"begin":581}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"54f5f647","span":{"end":594,"begin":581}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"6979efad","span":{"end":589,"begin":581}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"5a6d5a8f","span":{"end":655,"begin":642}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"4a67318f","span":{"end":647,"begin":642}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"315ba14a","span":{"end":733,"begin":727}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"17f9344b","span":{"end":789,"begin":761}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"27f0ad19","span":{"end":789,"begin":781}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"54e81b21","span":{"end":832,"begin":826}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"38d5b107","span":{"end":842,"begin":837}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"6650813a","span":{"end":974,"begin":958}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"44ea608c","span":{"end":1253,"begin":1219}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"50cf5a23","span":{"end":1232,"begin":1228}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"450794b4","span":{"end":1253,"begin":1245}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"273c947f","span":{"end":1370,"begin":1355}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"30457e14","span":{"end":1385,"begin":1372}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"1af1347d","span":{"end":1493,"begin":1485}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"632aa1a3","span":{"end":1555,"begin":1536}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"20765ed5","span":{"end":1541,"begin":1536}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"3b582111","span":{"end":1608,"begin":1584}}],"text":"Mosquito larvicidal and pupicidal activity of Euphorbia hirta Linn.

The LysR-type transcriptional regulator (LTTR) protein PqsR (MvfR) is a key component of alkyl-quinolone (AQ)-dependent QS in Pseudomonas aeruginosa. PqsR is activated by 2-alkyl-4-quinolones including the Pseudomonas quinolone signal (PQS; 2-heptyl-3-hydroxy-4(1H)-quinolone), its precursor 2-heptyl-4-hydroxyquinoline (HHQ) and their C9 congeners, 2-nonyl-3-hydroxy-4(1H)-quinolone (C9-PQS) and 2-nonyl-4-hydroxyquinoline (NHQ). These drive the autoinduction of AQ biosynthesis and the up-regulation of key virulence determinants as a function of bacterial population density. Consequently, PqsR constitutes a potential target for novel antibacterial agents which attenuate infection through the blockade of virulence. Here we present the crystal structures of the PqsR co-inducer binding domain (CBD) and a complex with the native agonist NHQ. We show that the structure of the PqsR CBD has an unusually large ligand-binding pocket in which a native AQ agonist is stabilized entirely by hydrophobic interactions. Through a ligand-based design strategy we synthesized and evaluated a series of 50 AQ and novel quinazolinone (QZN) analogues and measured the impact on AQ biosynthesis, virulence gene expression and biofilm development. The simple exchange of two isosteres (OH for NH\u2082) switches a QZN agonist to an antagonist with a concomitant impact on the induction of bacterial virulence factor production. We also determined the complex crystal structure of a QZN antagonist bound to PqsR revealing a similar orientation in the ligand binding pocket to the native agonist NHQ. This structure represents the first description of an LTTR-antagonist complex. Overall these studies present novel insights into LTTR ligand binding and ligand-based drug design and provide a chemical scaffold for further anti-P. aeruginosa virulence drug development by targeting the AQ receptor PqsR.\n","relations":[],"sourcedb":"BioNLP-ST-2016"},{"sourceid":"BB-event-24261996","denotations":[{"obj":"Bacteria","id":"251ebf23","span":{"end":31,"begin":11}},{"obj":"Bacteria","id":"29b732a2","span":{"end":170,"begin":150}},{"obj":"Bacteria","id":"1b70203f","span":{"end":257,"begin":252}},{"obj":"Bacteria","id":"51671b08","span":{"end":504,"begin":499}},{"obj":"Bacteria","id":"15051a0","span":{"end":602,"begin":597}},{"obj":"Bacteria","id":"1162410a","span":{"end":786,"begin":781}},{"obj":"Bacteria","id":"b09fac1","span":{"end":985,"begin":980}},{"obj":"Bacteria","id":"62df0ff3","span":{"end":1118,"begin":1113}},{"obj":"Bacteria","id":"61019f59","span":{"end":1436,"begin":1431}},{"obj":"Bacteria","id":"62e8f862","span":{"end":1493,"begin":1488}},{"obj":"Bacteria","id":"26f3d90c","span":{"end":1632,"begin":1627}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"3c49fab6","span":{"end":39,"begin":32}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"515f4131","span":{"end":68,"begin":57}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"74518890","span":{"end":310,"begin":292}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"4c5204af","span":{"end":302,"begin":297}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"3f3ddbd9","span":{"end":419,"begin":403}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"14c053c6","span":{"end":452,"begin":439}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"6c2d4cc6","span":{"end":526,"begin":517}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"30865a90","span":{"end":549,"begin":538}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"6134ac4a","span":{"end":680,"begin":658}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"777c9dc9","span":{"end":680,"begin":667}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"71b1a49c","span":{"end":729,"begin":718}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"73e132e0","span":{"end":855,"begin":844}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"3773862a","span":{"end":877,"begin":865}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"2472c7d8","span":{"end":871,"begin":865}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"589b028e","span":{"end":937,"begin":915}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"22175d4f","span":{"end":922,"begin":915}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"9fecdf1","span":{"end":1081,"begin":1072}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"3b809711","span":{"end":1076,"begin":1072}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"3b0f7d9d","span":{"end":1262,"begin":1248}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"236ab296","span":{"end":1287,"begin":1267}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"5c84624f","span":{"end":1318,"begin":1302}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"63034ed1","span":{"end":1334,"begin":1323}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"232024b9","span":{"end":1583,"begin":1576}}],"text":"Attenuated Bordetella pertussis vaccine protects against respiratory syncytial virus disease via an IL-17-dependent mechanism.\nWe attenuated virulent Bordetella pertussis by genetically eliminating or detoxifying three major toxins.

A test method using HE was developed in conjunction with Loop-mediated Isothermal Amplification (LAMP) combined with the real-time bioluminescent reporter system known as BART targeting the toxin B gene (tcdB). The HE-LAMP-BART method was evaluated in a pilot study on clinical fecal samples (tcdB(+), n\u200A=\u200A111; tcdB(-), n=\u200A107). The HE-LAMP-BART method showed 95.5% sensitivity and 100% specificity against a gold standard reference method using cytotoxigenic culture and also a silica-based robotic extraction followed by tcdB PCR to control for storage.

Infections of the conjunctiva cause the blinding disease trachoma, an immuno-pathological disease that is characterised by chronic conjunctival inflammation and fibrosis. The polymorphic Killer-cell Immunoglobulin-like Receptors (KIR) are found on Natural Killer cells and have co-evolved with the Human Leucocyte Antigen (HLA) class I system. Certain genetic constellations of KIR and HLA class I polymorphisms are associated with a number of diseases in which modulation of the innate responses to viral and intracellular bacterial pathogens is central.\nA sample of 134 Gambian pedigrees selected to contain at least one individual with conjunctival scarring in the F1 generation was used. Individuals (n\u200A=\u200A830) were genotyped for HLA class I and KIR gene families. Family Based Association Tests and Case Pseudo-control tests were used to extend tests for transmission disequilibrium to take full advantage of the family design, genetic model and phenotype.\nWe found that the odds of trachomatous scarring increased with the number of genome copies of HLA-C2 (C1\/C2 OR\u200A=\u200A2.29 BHP-value\u200A=\u200A0.006; C2\/C2 OR\u200A=\u200A3.97 BHP-value\u200A=\u200A0.0004) and further increased when both KIR2DL2 and KIR2DL3 (C2\/C2 OR\u200A=\u200A5.95 BHP-value\u200A=\u200A0.006) were present.\nTo explain the observations in the context of chlamydial infection and trachoma we propose a two-stage model of response and disease that balances the cytolytic response of KIR expressing NK cells with the ability to secrete interferon gamma, a combination that may cause pathology. The data presented indicate that HLA-C genotypes are important determinants of conjunctival scarring in trachoma and that KIR2DL2\/KIR2DL3 heterozygosity further increases risk of conjunctival scarring in individuals carrying HLA-C2.\n","relations":[],"sourcedb":"BioNLP-ST-2016"},{"sourceid":"BB-event-24722168","denotations":[{"obj":"Bacteria","id":"2fb69ff6","span":{"end":36,"begin":10}},{"obj":"Bacteria","id":"cda4919","span":{"end":1194,"begin":1168}},{"obj":"Bacteria","id":"7f4d9395","span":{"end":1199,"begin":1196}},{"obj":"Bacteria","id":"2f19f2aa","span":{"end":1291,"begin":1288}},{"obj":"Bacteria","id":"344b8190","span":{"end":1447,"begin":1444}},{"obj":"Bacteria","id":"6a078481","span":{"end":1515,"begin":1512}},{"obj":"Bacteria","id":"79c5636f","span":{"end":1737,"begin":1734}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"1929425f","span":{"end":58,"begin":46}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"718607eb","span":{"end":175,"begin":111}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"27f3b6d6","span":{"end":131,"begin":111}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"757f675c","span":{"end":120,"begin":111}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"2617f816","span":{"end":116,"begin":111}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"676f0a60","span":{"end":274,"begin":208}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"5d10455d","span":{"end":234,"begin":208}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"535b8c24","span":{"end":217,"begin":208}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"4a951911","span":{"end":213,"begin":208}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"55b62629","span":{"end":233,"begin":230}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"a53bb6f","span":{"end":283,"begin":278}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"5e63cad","span":{"end":447,"begin":441}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"6759f091","span":{"end":514,"begin":508}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"33a053d","span":{"end":525,"begin":519}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"14a54ef6","span":{"end":624,"begin":591}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"20921b9b","span":{"end":594,"begin":591}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"867ba60","span":{"end":681,"begin":650}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"5ba745bc","span":{"end":670,"begin":650}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"654b72c0","span":{"end":664,"begin":650}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"55b5e331","span":{"end":699,"begin":685}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"6034e75d","span":{"end":888,"begin":881}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"15fc442","span":{"end":917,"begin":893}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"3f3c7bdb","span":{"end":896,"begin":893}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"456abb66","span":{"end":922,"begin":919}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"2a3a299","span":{"end":977,"begin":955}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"7da10b5b","span":{"end":1044,"begin":1038}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"219f4597","span":{"end":1090,"begin":1083}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"31be6b49","span":{"end":1150,"begin":1128}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"2e16b08d","span":{"end":1336,"begin":1306}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"5b989dc7","span":{"end":1327,"begin":1306}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"70d8de","span":{"end":1316,"begin":1306}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"42561fba","span":{"end":1309,"begin":1306}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"595f4da5","span":{"end":1399,"begin":1393}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"46b695ec","span":{"end":1609,"begin":1604}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"408613cc","span":{"end":1656,"begin":1637}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"325f7fa9","span":{"end":1647,"begin":1637}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"11ce2e22","span":{"end":1791,"begin":1781}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"63a5d002","span":{"end":1847,"begin":1839}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"13cda7c9","span":{"end":1842,"begin":1839}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"5aa6202e","span":{"end":1888,"begin":1878}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"3af9aa66","span":{"end":1881,"begin":1878}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"771158fb","span":{"end":1918,"begin":1906}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"91c4a3f","span":{"end":2119,"begin":2111}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"62d0ac62","span":{"end":2156,"begin":2142}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"150d80c4","span":{"end":2145,"begin":2142}}],"text":"Probiotic Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG enhanced Th1 cellular immunity but did not affect antibody responses in a human gut microbiota transplanted neonatal gnotobiotic pig model.\nThis study aims to establish a human gut microbiota (HGM) transplanted gnotobiotic (Gn) pig model of human rotavirus (HRV) infection and diarrhea, and to verify the dose-effects of probiotics on HRV vaccine-induced immune responses. Our previous studies using the Gn pig model found that probiotics dose-dependently regulated both T cell and B cell immune responses induced by rotavirus vaccines. We generated the HGM transplanted neonatal Gn pigs through daily feeding of neonatal human fecal suspension to germ-free pigs for 3 days starting at 12 hours after birth. We found that attenuated HRV (AttHRV) vaccination conferred similar overall protection against rotavirus diarrhea and virus shedding in Gn pigs and HGM transplanted Gn pigs. HGM promoted the development of the neonatal immune system, as evidenced by the significantly enhanced IFN-γ producing T cell responses and reduction of regulatory T cells and their cytokine production in the AttHRV-vaccinated pigs. The higher dose Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (LGG) feeding (14 doses, up to 109 colony-forming-unit [CFU]\/dose) effectively increased the LGG counts in the HGM Gn pig intestinal contents and significantly enhanced HRV-specific IFN-γ producing T cell responses to the AttHRV vaccine. Lower dose LGG (9 doses, up to 106 CFU\/dose) was ineffective. Neither doses of LGG significantly improved the protection rate, HRV-specific IgA and IgG antibody titers in serum, or IgA antibody titers in intestinal contents compared to the AttHRV vaccine alone, suggesting that an even higher dose of LGG is needed to overcome the influence of the microbiota to achieve the immunostimulatory effect in the HGM pigs. This study demonstrated that HGM Gn pig is an applicable animal model for studying immune responses to rotavirus vaccines and can be used for studying interventions (i.e., probiotics and prebiotics) that may enhance the immunogenicity and protective efficacy of vaccines through improving the gut microbiota. \n","relations":[],"sourcedb":"BioNLP-ST-2016"},{"sourceid":"BB-event-24837294","denotations":[{"obj":"Bacteria","id":"6826c41e","span":{"end":36,"begin":16}},{"obj":"Bacteria","id":"3003697","span":{"end":240,"begin":220}},{"obj":"Bacteria","id":"64d43929","span":{"end":680,"begin":668}},{"obj":"Bacteria","id":"1d269ed7","span":{"end":970,"begin":965}},{"obj":"Bacteria","id":"437ebf59","span":{"end":1171,"begin":1166}},{"obj":"Bacteria","id":"41c89d2f","span":{"end":1284,"begin":1279}},{"obj":"Bacteria","id":"410e94e","span":{"end":1625,"begin":1620}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"2d691f3d","span":{"end":90,"begin":74}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"1bdbf9be","span":{"end":85,"begin":74}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"1e7f2e0f","span":{"end":314,"begin":275}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"1da6ee17","span":{"end":280,"begin":275}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"78d39a69","span":{"end":296,"begin":281}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"3c818ac4","span":{"end":308,"begin":297}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"5b69d40d","span":{"end":321,"begin":316}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"71154f21","span":{"end":364,"begin":345}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"15f193b8","span":{"end":1076,"begin":1071}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"2516fc68","span":{"end":1115,"begin":1102}}],"text":"Modification of Streptococcus mutans Cnm by PgfS contributes to adhesion, endothelial cell invasion, and virulence.\nExpression of the surface protein Cnm has been directly implicated in the ability of certain strains of Streptococcus mutans to bind to collagen and to invade human coronary artery endothelial cells (HCAEC) and in the killing of Galleria mellonella. Sequencing analysis of Cnm(+) strains revealed that cnm is located between the core genes SMU.2067 and SMU.2069. Reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) analysis showed that cnm is cotranscribed with SMU.2067, encoding a putative glycosyltransferase referred to here as PgfS (protein glycosyltransferase of streptococci). Notably, Cnm contains a threonine-rich domain predicted to undergo O-linked glycosylation. The previously shown abnormal migration pattern of Cnm, the presence of the threonine-rich domain, and the molecular linkage of cnm with pgfS lead us to hypothesize that PgfS modifies Cnm. A ΔpgfS strain showed defects in several traits associated with Cnm expression, including collagen binding, HCAEC invasion, and killing of G. mellonella. Western blot analysis revealed that Cnm from the ΔpgfS mutant migrated at a lower molecular weight than that from the parent strain. In addition, Cnm produced by ΔpgfS was highly susceptible to proteinase K degradation, in contrast to the high-molecular-weight Cnm version found in the parent strain. Lectin-binding analyses confirmed the glycosylated nature of Cnm and strongly suggested the presence of N-acetylglucosamine residues attached to Cnm. Based on these findings, the phenotypes observed in ΔpgfS are most likely associated with defects in Cnm glycosylation that affects protein function, stability, or both. In conclusion, this study demonstrates that Cnm is a glycoprotein and that posttranslational modification mediated by PgfS contributes to the virulence-associated phenotypes linked to Cnm. \n","relations":[],"sourcedb":"BioNLP-ST-2016"},{"sourceid":"BB-event-24959701","denotations":[{"obj":"Bacteria","id":"304a9d7b","span":{"end":73,"begin":55}},{"obj":"Bacteria","id":"6bfdb014","span":{"end":113,"begin":95}},{"obj":"Bacteria","id":"72889280","span":{"end":486,"begin":468}},{"obj":"Bacteria","id":"606fc505","span":{"end":514,"begin":507}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"4aa3d36","span":{"end":93,"begin":87}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"2d140a7","span":{"end":144,"begin":140}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"347bdeef","span":{"end":208,"begin":202}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"2aa27288","span":{"end":627,"begin":610}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"7f34a967","span":{"end":734,"begin":655}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"77e80a5e","span":{"end":697,"begin":655}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"1d8e2eea","span":{"end":677,"begin":674}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"240139e1","span":{"end":734,"begin":720}}],"text":"Epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and outcomes of Streptococcus suis infection in humans.\nStreptococcus suis, a bacterium that affects pigs, is a neglected pathogen that causes systemic disease in humans.

In addition, the Smith strain, which is coagulase-positive and encapsulated, showed on rabbit peritoneum a degree of adhesion smaller than that of the Cowan I strain and similar to that of the Wood 46 strain. These quantitative results were corroborated by examination of the bacteria on thin sections of peritoneum or on whole mesentery samples with fluorescence microscopy. With fluorochroming either with acridine orange or fluorescent homologous antibodies, we could detect a preferential localization of the bacteria on the epithelium and also on fibers of the mesentery. Even if the Cowan I strain produces Protein A, this substance does not seem to have been involved in the adhesion of this strain to rabbit tissues, since IgG did not affect the degree of its adhesion. Treatment by Na metaperiodate of the peritoneum had an inhibitory effect of about 50% on the degree of adhesion; several other known inhibitors had no effect. The higher affinity of the Cowan I strain for the peritoneum or the mesentery, when compared with the Wood 46 strain, is an observation which could contribute to the study and understanding of adhesion, presumably an element of the experimental pathogenicity of Staphylococcus.\n","relations":[],"sourcedb":"BioNLP-ST-2016"},{"sourceid":"BB-event-7424745","denotations":[{"obj":"Bacteria","id":"3ae66c85","span":{"end":21,"begin":12}},{"obj":"Bacteria","id":"16943e88","span":{"end":90,"begin":78}},{"obj":"Bacteria","id":"4604b900","span":{"end":107,"begin":98}},{"obj":"Bacteria","id":"73d6d0c","span":{"end":323,"begin":314}},{"obj":"Bacteria","id":"e36bb2a","span":{"end":455,"begin":446}},{"obj":"Bacteria","id":"3961a41a","span":{"end":706,"begin":697}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"5a4ed68f","span":{"end":36,"begin":22}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"367795c7","span":{"end":29,"begin":22}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"d2387c8","span":{"end":61,"begin":42}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"3956b302","span":{"end":166,"begin":143}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"1500e009","span":{"end":160,"begin":153}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"1fd386c3","span":{"end":205,"begin":186}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"edf4f36","span":{"end":368,"begin":363}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"29d334c","span":{"end":423,"begin":405}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"100f9bbe","span":{"end":470,"begin":465}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"13e9f2e2","span":{"end":686,"begin":672}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"673bb956","span":{"end":679,"begin":672}}],"text":"A survey of Moraxella corneal ulcers in a derelict population.\nInfection with diplobacilli of the Moraxella group was the most common cause of bacterial corneal ulcer in a population of derelict alcoholics living in the Bowery district in New York City from 1965 through 1968.

Our findings are relevant for prevention strategies, antibiotic usage, and vaccine design.\n","relations":[],"sourcedb":"BioNLP-ST-2016"},{"sourceid":"BB-event-9804019","denotations":[{"obj":"Bacteria","id":"7882c44a","span":{"end":1199,"begin":1186}},{"obj":"Bacteria","id":"32639b12","span":{"end":1281,"begin":1261}},{"obj":"Bacteria","id":"20d11153","span":{"end":1345,"begin":1336}},{"obj":"Bacteria","id":"3887cf88","span":{"end":1351,"begin":1347}},{"obj":"Bacteria","id":"5649ec46","span":{"end":1436,"begin":1432}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"78dc4696","span":{"end":20,"begin":0}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"502f8b57","span":{"end":111,"begin":76}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"5652f555","span":{"end":148,"begin":120}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"4fe01805","span":{"end":221,"begin":209}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"55120f99","span":{"end":309,"begin":276}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"794b435f","span":{"end":347,"begin":327}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"38f2e97e","span":{"end":412,"begin":385}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"779dfe55","span":{"end":452,"begin":417}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"323659f8","span":{"end":430,"begin":417}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"1144a55a","span":{"end":510,"begin":470}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"3e521715","span":{"end":475,"begin":470}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"26a529dc","span":{"end":510,"begin":485}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"265c5d69","span":{"end":544,"begin":535}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"1286528d","span":{"end":587,"begin":570}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"3cc20577","span":{"end":575,"begin":570}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"33a630fa","span":{"end":609,"begin":598}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"775594f2","span":{"end":603,"begin":598}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"5767b2af","span":{"end":641,"begin":617}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"7b22ec89","span":{"end":682,"begin":674}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"790132f7","span":{"end":771,"begin":702}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"2228db21","span":{"end":771,"begin":748}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"48b0e701","span":{"end":826,"begin":810}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"241a0c3a","span":{"end":815,"begin":810}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"547c04c4","span":{"end":858,"begin":834}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"30e92cb9","span":{"end":870,"begin":864}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"7fae4d4a","span":{"end":1094,"begin":1074}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"ba1f559","span":{"end":1160,"begin":1138}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"3f4f9acd","span":{"end":1244,"begin":1235}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"46baf579","span":{"end":1378,"begin":1354}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"4bf324f9","span":{"end":1492,"begin":1462}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"4f7c0be3","span":{"end":1552,"begin":1542}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"ca66933","span":{"end":1578,"begin":1570}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"1d2644e3","span":{"end":1656,"begin":1648}},{"obj":"Habitat","id":"4fa06f52","span":{"end":1682,"begin":1658}}],"text":"Aurioscope earpieces--a potential vector of infection?\nto determine whether non disposable aurioscope earpieces used in community paediatric clinics harbored pathogenic micro-organisms, and to explore primary pediatrician perception of the possibility of cross infection from contaminated aurioscope earpieces and of how their aurioscope earpieced are cleaned.\nrandomized survey.\nfour community pediatric clinics.\n42 pediatricians' aurioscope earpieces were cultured on blood agar and mannitol-salt-agar plates by two methods: (1) The earpieces were rolled for 5 s onto blood agar plates (TSA + 5% sheep blood, and a mannitol-salt-agar-plate). (2) The entire surface of the earpiece was swabbed with a sterile cotton tipped applicator moistened in sterile saline solution and was inoculated immediately onto a blood agar plate, and a mannitol-salt-agar-plate. The plates were incubated at 37 degrees C for 48 h and examined for colony growth at 24 and 48 h of incubation. Culture results were recorded as mean numbers of colony-forming units (CFUs).\n36 from 42 (86%) of the aurioscope earpieces were colonized by micro-organisms. Heavily contaminated earpieces were found in six (14%). Staphylococci were isolated from 27 (64%) of the earpieces: 19 (45%) being Staphylococci aureus coagulase positive, 4 (9%) were methicillin resistant S. aureus (MRSA).\nNon disposable earpieces can harbor potentially pathogenic bacteria including MRSA. The increased trend for children with immunodeficiency to be managed in an ambulatory setting, often by physicians who also work in hospital, might be a risk of spreading potentially serious infections to such patients. Non disposable earpieces should be regularly disinfected to minimize the spread of infection.\n","relations":[],"sourcedb":"BioNLP-ST-2016"}]
