T2	Paragraph 199 2107	Many attempts have been made to endow enzymes with new catalytic activities. One general strategy involves the creation of random combinatorial libraries of mutants associated with an efficient screening or selection scheme. Phage display has been shown to greatly facilitate the selection of polypeptides with desired properties by establishing a close link between the polypeptide and the gene that encodes it. Selection of phage displayed enzymes for new catalytic activities remains a challenge. The aim of this study was to display the serine protease subtilisin 309 (savinase) from Bacillus lentus on the surface of filamentous fd phage and to develop selection schemes that allow the extraction of subtilisin variants with a changed substrate specificity from libraries. Subtilisins are produced as secreted preproenzyme that mature in active enzyme autocatalytically. They have a broad substrate specificity but exhibit a significant preference for hydrophobic residues and very limited reactivity toward charged residues at the P4 site in the substrate. Here, we show that savinase can be functionally displayed on phage in the presence of the proteic inhibitor CI2. The free enzyme is released from its complex with CI2 upon addition of the anionic detergent LAS. The phage-enzyme can be panned on streptavidin beads after labelling by reaction with (biotin-N-epsilon-aminocaproyl-cystamine-N'-glutaryl)-l-Ala-l-Ala-l-P ro-Phe(P)-diphenyl ester. Reactions of libraries, in which residues 104 and 107 forming part of the S4 pocket have been randomised, with (biotin-N-epsilon-aminocaproyl-cystamine-N'-glutaryl)-alpha-l-Lys-l-A la-l-Pro-Phe(P)-diphenylester allowed us to select enzymes with increased specific activity for a substrate containing a lysine in P4. Parameters influencing the selection as for instance the efficiency of maturation of mutant enzymes in libraries have been investigated.
