Immune response to infection with Salmonella typhimurium in mice.
Infection of mice with Salmonella typhimurium results in systemic infection and a disease similar to that seen in humans after infection with S. typhi. The innate immune system can restrict replication of S. typhimurium to a certain degree, but for effective control and eradication of bacteria, acquired immunity is essential. Salmonella infection induces the generation of specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, and both T cell populations are important for protection during primary and secondary responses, although the mechanisms underlying T cell-mediated protection are not yet completely understood. Infection with S. typhimurium also results in a strong antibody response to Salmonella antigens and, in contrast to most other intracellular bacteria, this antibody response participates in protection. In summary, the response to S. typhimurium involves both T and B cell-mediated immunity, and mechanisms mediated by both lymphocyte populations are important for control of primary infection and protection against secondary infection.
